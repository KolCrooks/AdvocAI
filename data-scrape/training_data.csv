" Q: Mechanic wouldn't let me have my car after i paid him for a service.
T: GOOD
B: I'm a non-resident driving through Illinois. My vehicle broke down. I had it taken to a local mechanic. After investigating, the mechanic told me the engine was seized. He charged me for an hour. I paid him $85.

He was pressuring me to sign a contract to store my vehicle in the back of his shop. I am from out of state so I needed time to plan for the vehicle to he transported up north. I turned him down and said I'd like to have it towed elsewhere. That's when he kicked me out of his shop and held my vehicle hostage.

I called my insurance and my insurance told me to call the local police. I did. The police showed up, talked to the mechanic, then told me the mechanic wanted an additional $85. I told the police I had already paid him $85. I showed the police my receipt. The police talked to the mechanic again. The police returned and told me my only two options are to either pay an additional $85 for *""administration fees""*—or, take the matter to small claims court.

Ultimately, I paid the mechanic an additional $66 in cash. He finally rolled my car out and told me to get off of his property. Then he locked up and left.

...how is that even legal?

","It isn't. You paid the fee associated with the service. The receipt is proof. You can absolutely file in small claims against them, but it's going to take time and money. Likely more than what you've lost, so it might not be worth it to you in the end. END"

","You should have called the cops again, or better yet have gone to the nearest police station and get someone higher up the chain of command to have them release the car to you.

Since the only damages you have incurred are the $66 you can attempt small claims but tbh it would be a waste of time and money even if you won. The cost to file (which is also recoverable if ruled in your favor) would be more if not double your initial damages. So you'd risk an afternoon plus an additional $120 or however much it costs in Illinois.

Nonlegal/realistic options are to look into reporting them to whatever agency would oversee their license, reporting them to the BBB, leaving reviews via google or all other sites they are listed. If you payed via CC then call up the number to dispute the charge made(this generally will cost them a one-time fee to respond to the disputed charge.) If possible get the police report/incident report of the situation to attach to the dispute if that would help your case. END"

" Q: Daughter 13yo send to ""Wilderness Boot camp"" BlueFire in Idaho by mother - how to battle this?
T: GOOD
B: I am a Father of a 13yo daughter. I am looking for legal advice to try to save daughter from being institutionalized.  

( I was referred by a member in r/troubledteens , so this is a duplicate just for the legal advice ) 

Here is the background

I live in Arizona and my daughter used to live primarily with me and some time with Mother. Her mother and I are separated for a few years. Recently she wanted to go live with her mother and just visit here, and after some time, the court gave the mother mother temp. legal custody. Within a few months since she moved to her Mom's , she experimented with Alcohol , sexual relations with some boys and eventually fell into depression and suicide attempts. I tried to get custody back , but the Judge won't listen to me and left the custody with Mother, who convinced her ( judge ) she will do anything for the daughter and that the daughter wants to stay with her. The mother also got a psychologist and a psychiatrist to evaluate my daughter without my knowledge and they recommended for ""Change of placement"" , By the time I learned that this means to place her outside of home and within days, the educational consultants the Mother hired at the advice of the psychologist, placed my daughter into this camp for 8-12 weeks. I don't know what kind of threats or convincing she did with my daughter since she went there apparently with her mother without physically  forcing her.

I am very worried about my daughter ending living her lives in institutions since I read that these camps are the first step from which most children are sent into another ""therapeutic program"" or ""therapeutic"" boarding schoos and that's what they do.

My daughter used to be an excellent student all her life until last year, very active in dance team of her school ,polite, delicate and typically follow rules. She did some mistakes but She cooperate with her  therapist and treatment ( i.e. she will go to appointments and agree to take medication if she will need it ) . No drugs, No alcohol addition, No violence. Very good kid up until several months ago.

I am devastated and do not want or think my daughter needs to spend her life there. She has a house here with me ( and separately with mother) , but how do I fight this? In here? In Idaho?

" Q: Tow truck company stole our rental car
T: GOOD
B: Location: Nyc

This is a long and complicated story so i bolded the important parts .

Me and my boyfriend's car was in the shop so we got a rental car for a week, as we both need a car to work and make money. We had no problems with the car and we were set to return it Friday morning. Thursday night we parked the car a few blocks from our house . Our neighborhood has basically no parking so we had to park near a fire hydrant about 6 feet away **which is illegal but does not warrant a tow only a ticket** from the city. It was extremely late and we were exhausted so we just said fuck it, we'll pay the ticket if it comes to that. We were not parked in a tow zone, in front of a driveway, none of that.

The next morning the car was gone. I called the nearest precinct and they said the NYPD did not tow it but they have a citywide database so they found out who towed it - A private towing company, lets call them Terrible Towing Company (TTC). I called TTC and they told me  **I could not come get the car not even my personal belongings inside it ,** and that only the rental company could come get it as they owned the car not me.  **TTC also told me that the rental company had called it in to be towed,** which did not make sense because I had just spoken to the rental company, letting them know I was on my way to return the car, and they said okay no problem.

This is where it gets weird. I called the rental company and let them know what had happened. They said **they did not call it in to be towed** . I told them okay I will file a complaint at the precinct and try my best to get the car back on Monday (my actual car got out the shop on Monday and the tow company is very far away so I couldn't use regular public transportation).

Fast forward to Monday: Me and my boyfriend go to the precinct. They tell us we can't file a regular criminal complaint because it's technically not larceny. We have to file a complaint with the DCA or BBB and bring it to small claims court.  Mind you the cop also says ""This happens a lot in this neighborhood...Hating neighbors call the cops on each other all the time for petty things"" ... (Me and my bf just moved over here).

Then we drove to the tow yard. Nobody was there and gates are closed so can't see inside. I called the tow company, and the guy tells me ""**The bank took the car to Long Island. It got repossessed.** You can't get it or get your things from inside, only the rental company can do that."" I try to press him and tell him that he lied to me, the rental company did not call the car to be towed, and it did not get repossessed. He tells me talk to the rental company, not his problem. I say where did the bank take the car. He says talk to the rental company. Etc...

So. I call the rental company. They tell me the tow company is lying, it's impossible that the car got repossessed, etc., and furthermore the rental company would know if the bank took it and nobody notified them.

HERE'S THE THING. The rental company charges per day. I am racking up $500 and counting in extra rental fees that I am not financially prepared for, not to mention possible tow fees that they might try to hit me with. How can I resolve this legally? Is there a way I can sue the tow truck company in small claims court and have them pay the cost of my rental fees? Can I even put a larger lawsuit together from other people who have been victim to their illegal towing?

Also note: The reviews of the towing company is hilarious. All one star, saying ""I had to call the police to get my car back"" and ""They are crooks, they hold people's car for ransom"" etc. They have been doing this for years.

PLEASE HELP!!! Sorry for length of post.

TL;DR: Tow truck company illegally towed my rental car off the street and is now claiming the bank repossessed it, even though the rental company says this is not true. Tow company is refusing to tell me where the car is.

" Q: A guy sued me in November over medical bills, he had no bills, should I counter sue?

","Other than the inconvenience of having to deal with it -- even through an insurance company -- what are your damages?  

Your insurance company is the one responsible for your rates going up, not the other driver.   It typically means that  your insurer doesn't believe the fault for the accident was 100% the other guy's fault and 0% yours.

If you think Geico is just jacking your rates up to chase bad money, try quoting out rates from other companies.  If they don't undercut Geico by a wide margin, it's because statistically you represent a greater risk than you did before the accident happened.

Auto insurance pricing is generally very efficient.  If you were a low-risk customer, they would be fighting to keep your business by continuing to offer low rates. END"

" Q: Boss is cutting off A/C when she leaves, leaving my mom in 85 degree heat. Refuses to let her have a fan. Is this legal?
T: GOOD
B: Posting for my mother. We live in Washington state.

She's a receptionist at a local family owned business, and works 10am to 5pm. Her boss leaves at 3pm and when she leaves, she turns off the A/C. They've always had issues with heating and cooling there because it is an old building, and it's pricey to keep the A/C on. So, despite having employees and customers still in the building for 2-3 more hours, the boss turns off A/C when she's all done.

Even with A/C, it's around 80 degrees in there. My mom attempted to have a standing fan by her desk but her boss took it down, saying it was ""tacky."" Their compromise? A tiny, portable fan about the size of a bowling ball that doesn't work.

Today it was 101 degrees, and 86 in the building when my mom left. She was nauseous due to the heat and felt fatigued and ill (we're assuming heat exhaustion).

I feel like this is in a grey area of legality. Surely it can't be legal to have workers working in certain temperatures, right? She told me tonight that she's strongly considering not going to work tomorrow because the conditions are so unbearable.

Advice? Tips?

###

","These folks would know if there is an office temperature requirement in WA:  https://lni.wa.gov/

Fed OSHA doesn’t spell out set temperatures in offices, or in any work site.  They use general duty clause saying workplaces have to be free from hazards that can kill or seriously injure. Some of the answers you got here are off the mark.  No, water alone doesn’t make every worker safe from heat, and yes 86 degrees could be considered hazardous depending on other factors. 86 in an office is most likely going to be seen as a matter of comfort and OSHA addresses dangers, not comfort. That’s not a hard rule though.

https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/section5-duties

&gt;Duties
(a)
Each employer --

(1)
29 USC 654
shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;

(2)
shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act.

(b)
Each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct.


P.S. Look into cooling safety and sports clothing. There are fabrics that wick sweat better or can be soaked in water to provide evaporative cooling. Arctic Cool and Occunomix are two I know of.  There are neck scarves and face masks made to cool.  Your head is the biggest place of heat loss and many have to wear masks at work now. END"

T: GOOD
B: Back in April, my severely abusive wife left me after joining a satanic cult. She lived with me until a month ago, and she met a guy online through her cult and went to visit him 2 weeks ago, 3 states away. We agreed on a 50/50 custody split but everything is backed up from covid, and she has not signed the divorce papers yet. This guy has a long criminal history including a couple DUIs, some burglaries, malicious destruction of property. Clearly an alcohol problem. She met him two weeks ago, and invited him to live with her and he just flew in today. Now, this guy is going to be sharing a bed with my daughter now. I know this, because I brought it up to my wife about how dumb it is to introduce a guy she's seeing that she barely knows while my daughter is struggling really hard to deal with the split. She hasn't been able to sleep in her own bed saying ""I don't want you to leave like mommy did"" but she does the same thing at her place, saying she's afraid her mother will leave her. My soon to be ex wife mentioned that she has no problem with my daughter sharing a bed with them, and she barely knows the guy. Do I have a case to fight for sole custody? I really want to, and it will be expensive but my mother in law wants my daughter away from her too so is going to fund it if we have a decent chance. 

Sorry if my grammar sucks. My hands are shaking from rage thinking about this stranger who she barely knows sleeping in the same bed as my daughter who is my everything. My lawyer has been of little help lately. I just want my daughter to be safe and my heart sinks every time she has to be with her mother because she is such a different person in that cult, its truly scary.

Edit- I should also mention that my daughter hyperventilates every time she has to go back with her mother, telling me she doesn't love her anymore because she left, and ""does weird things with her new friends"" but can't elaborate on what with her limited vocabulary

Another Edit- Thank you all! My daughter is getting removed from my wife's care today, but my mother in law wants the 2500 back that I have to pay which sucks because I can't afford it right now but its still worth every struggle to get her back with me

B: Riverside county, California.
Two and a half years ago, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up. She told me that her and the kids would move to her mom's in nearby San Diego, but instead, she took my daughter to Texas to live with her new ex-con boyfriend, completely lying to me. I have an open case for custody ongoing right now. We've had had a couple of hearings since with the only orders being that I get 3 phone calls a week with my daughter, preferably by video, but due to some tech issues, these are done mostly as a regular phone call that I do record to use for reference in keeping a journal of our conversations. Tonight, I called at our normal time window and chatted with my daughter about her weekend and asked how her brother was doing and she said fine. I then asked if he is doing anything to annoy her, and she told me that he was playing with his penis in front of her again. Now I already plan to file a complaint with Child Protective Services in Texas using an online submission, but what I need to know now is if there is anything I should file here in Riverside County, California that can help get my daughter out of this situation and quickly?

Update: I have filed a report with Texas CPS and they will be investigating. Now the question is what happens next. Do I file for emergency custody here in California, where our custody case is, and do I file right now or wait till CPS gets back to me?

Update 2. Wow. This is blowing up and I am truly overwhelmed and appreciative of all the advice and support I've gotten. It's nearly 4:00 in the morning here and I have not been able to sleep. It looks like it's going to be a very busy day for me. I called CPS last night and filed the report with them. I'm a little apprehensive about calling the cops as well. The reasons for my reluctance is that I don't want to further traumatize my daughter by having her see either her mother or autistic brother arrested. I am hoping CPS will take her away before seeing anything like that. I will be filing an ex parte before noon today to get emergency custody, hopefully I can get the wording right for the judge to grant me that. I do not have a lawyer to do this for me, as I just can't afford it. I'm an unpaid caregiver to my disabled mother who just gets room and board for my work with her. Though I am working through my doctor to get my veteran benefits going, so I can have some kind of income, as it is impossible for me to work given my mothers needs and medical issues.

" Q: Vet Malpractice advice
T: GOOD
B: I am on vacation and heartbroken. I brought my 6 year old long hair to a veterinarian office that boards animals. He is diabetic so I had to take him here while my other 2 cats remained at home. He was there for 2 days and they called me to tell me that he passed.

I have the phone conversations recorded. They claim that they gave him his shots Sat night, Sunday Morning/Night, and then today when they came in he was lethargic and they knew something was wrong. They checked his glucose level and it was 23. They claim they gave him IV and then shortly after he had a 5 second seizure, but then pepped up, and died shortly after.

I asked ""what was his glucose levels the last 2 days?"". They responded with ""we never took his glucose levels"". I asked ""how much was he eating before this happened"". They responded with ""they were feeding him dry so they weren't sure how much he was eating"". They overdosed my cat on insulin and had no idea whether he needed it. I can't imagine a situation where a vet could knowingly give a cat insulin without knowing whether he was eating or what his levels were. He was young, healthy, and fine before this. You bring a cat to board at a vet because you expect them to treat their health professionally. I got no calls, no warnings. If they called me yesterday and said ""he hasn't been eating- his glucose levels are low so we don't feel comfortable dosing him"", I would have left vacation and came home for him. I would have had a relative pick him up and bring him home. I know how glucose levels float around with diabetic cats. I see his levels spike every time I bring him for a checkup or shots. I have never seen his levels go below 150. He always floated around 175-200 and sometimes at the vet that number would jump to 250 or more.

I really can't fathom how this could have happened. Am I wrong or is this blatant malpractice? Anyone have any advice? I feel so guilty that I trusted this institution with my animal. If I never left he would still be alive. His main vet would never administer insulin without knowing his glucose levels. He also always advised that if I didn't see him to eat then I shouldn't administer insulin because his levels could drop. They a.) didn't monitor his eating b.) check his glucose levels till it was too late. These are the 2 biggest NO-NOs when it comes to a diabetic animal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should also add that I live in New York and the reason we brought him here is because they call themselves a "" Veterinary Hospital Pet Resort and Spa"" and that my cat would have an entire 4'x10' room to himself where he would be cared for by vets. 

Thanks for any help.

","First of all I am so so sorry.  This is horrible.  I would be have a combination of crippling sorrow and fury and I have a special fondness for long hair cats.  NAL but volunteer with a rescue

I fostered a diabetic animal before and know how crucial the glucose monitoring is -- I did it twice a day and kept a handwritten log.  When I was away someone else did the monitoring and feeding.  

I take it you provided the vet hospital with the appropriate records/instructions about the health of the cat.  Yes the entire point of boarding at a vet is to have appropriate vet care and having glucose monitoring 

I would consider reporting this to the veterinary board.

http://www.op.nysed.gov/opd/

There is precedent in NYS for suing and being awarded for mental suffering when it comes to a pet -- I refer you to Corso v Crawford Dog and Cat Hospital  415 N.Y.S.2d (182 N.Y.City Civ.Ct., 1979)

T: GOOD
B: I am an officer for a non-profit and they keep getting upset with me because I do not like to pre-sign checks. Our checks require two signatures and they like to have a couple of blank, fully signed checks 'just in case'. They ""have always done it this way.""  And swear they are not going to do anything bad. My compromise has been to write 'ps' under my signature 'just in case' I need to say ""IDK who authorized that, it was a pre-signed check."" How crazy am I?

###

","Having pre-signed checks around ""just in case"" suggests that the organization isn't taking its own financial controls seriously, at least. If you're willing to assume good faith, they may just find the signing requirements silly, but this is also the perfect habit to cultivate if you want the ability to spend the company's money at the drop of a hat, without review, too.

Assume that one day you may be called to explain any checks you sign, either to the tax man or to the courts, and proceed accordingly. If your fellow officers think you're being a hard-nosed rules lawyer about it, well, worse things have happened: if there is malfeasance about, you'd rather it happened under their watch, not yours. Your ""ps"" notation only shows that you're aware of this lax attitude, and likely won't protect you if a check you signed turns up in a fraud or embezzlement investigation: expect to hear that you clearly knew, so you should have known better.

If your company is facing any kind of audit, this is the kind of thing auditors love to know about, as it's both a clear deficiency to report back to the board, and a good place for them to start looking for other, more serious problems. END"

" Q: [US-MO] My landlord withheld all of my security deposit for “untreatable odor.” This odor was a result of mold and mushrooms growing out of a wall that I notified him of months before the lease ended
T: GOOD
B: [US-MO] So back in March I stopped living in my apartment due to COVID and all my classes going remote. I came back maybe 3 weeks later to move some stuff out and I noticed my bathroom kind of smelled sour. I thought it was because I didn’t clean the toilet before I left. So I cleaned it, and left.

I came back in another 2 weeks to get some stuff and there were mushrooms growing out of my wall. The smell was not just in the bathroom but also the bedroom. I immediately called my landlord and he gave me a lecture about humidity in the apartment and that if I’m not living there or running the AC things can get wet. I told him I don’t care, and to get rid of the mushrooms. He said he’d get maintenance to take care of it.

I come back in a month to move the rest of my things out. The mushrooms were STILL there. There was visible black mold coming out of the wall. I did my best to clean the rest of the apartment, cut the mushroom stems and tried to bleach where the black mold was growing. I lit a candle while I was cleaning and upon leaving the apartment just smelled like chocolate and bleach.

Yesterday I got a letter from him stating I would not get any of my $500 security deposit back because of “untreatable odor/damage” to the apartment. Is there anything I can do about this?

###

","You can sue.

That's the normal dispute system. Go to small claims court in the county or city that you are in and sue for the amount of money. Missouri does allow the landlord to withhold from the security deposit, but only things that that you cause. So, if you take a hammer to the wall then you would be responsible. If you also never sweep off the back porch which causes the wood to rot under a pile of leaves then you would also be responsible. Normal wear and tear doesn't count against you.

He is going to claim that you didn't mothball the place when you left it which led to the damage. You point out that you told him about the damage before you left the first time. If you have pictures or video of before you left the first time *AND* when you came back to move your stuff out then that would be very strong.

The judge would then determine who should have to pay for the water damage, fungus, and mold. Small claims is pretty cheap, so even if you lose then you're not out a lot of money. The landlords in college towns often assume that college students aren't going to fight stuff like this, so sometimes getting the notification of a court date gets them to back off. END"

T: BAD
B: [US-MO] So back in March I stopped living in my apartment due to COVID and all my classes going remote. I came back maybe 3 weeks later to move some stuff out and I noticed my bathroom kind of smelled sour. I thought it was because I didn’t clean the toilet before I left. So I cleaned it, and left.

I came back in another 2 weeks to get some stuff and there were mushrooms growing out of my wall. The smell was not just in the bathroom but also the bedroom. I immediately called my landlord and he gave me a lecture about humidity in the apartment and that if I’m not living there or running the AC things can get wet. I told him I don’t care, and to get rid of the mushrooms. He said he’d get maintenance to take care of it.

I come back in a month to move the rest of my things out. The mushrooms were STILL there. There was visible black mold coming out of the wall. I did my best to clean the rest of the apartment, cut the mushroom stems and tried to bleach where the black mold was growing. I lit a candle while I was cleaning and upon leaving the apartment just smelled like chocolate and bleach.

Yesterday I got a letter from him stating I would not get any of my $500 security deposit back because of “untreatable odor/damage” to the apartment. Is there anything I can do about this?

None of the neighbors are happy as the tree is a major character-maker and shade provider for the street, but apparently the cutting is a done deal and they will spend about $20,000 to remove it. As part of the removal process, I have gotten a note that they will shut off power to my house during the removal process for 4 days in the middle of summer, from 8am-6pm each day. I work from home and also have a dog, and the letter just states that the power will be shut off, which is a huge inconvenience and there's no way I can stay home when the house will inevitably reach into the 90s. And then extremely stress out my A/C unit when the power comes back on to get it to a livable temperature.

" Q: Woke up to an email saying the DOT was tearing my place down (tenant in a college-town townhouse)
T: GOOD
B: A couple days ago my roommates and I woke up to an email from our leasing office stating that our unit was 1 of 8 being torn down by the DOT due to expanding our street into a 2 lane road. We were told that we’d be contacted by the NC DOT about possible relocation fees, paying for moving expenses, etc. 

However, our leasing office is being very “shady” about everything. They claim they don’t know anything but when I finally got in contact with the DOT, they claimed that our leasing company wouldn’t give them our information to get in touch with us. My leasing company is getting millions for this deal but it seems like we are being kicked to the curb. 

We are all in college, fairly young, and have no idea what to do. Signing a lease in October/November is going to be significantly more expensive than what we are currently paying for rent. Will the DOT pay the rent difference? Should my leasing company be helping us out with anything? I’d appreciate any information/help.

*also if this is not where I should post this please let me know!

###

","When does your lease end ?   When does your landlord say you need to vacate ?

Examine your lease carefully for a ""condemnation clause"" or other reference to ""eminent domain"".  It may be important about whether the DOT bought the land from your landlord in an ordinary sale, or if they used their power of eminent domain to compel the landlord to sell it to them.

North Carolina also has separate sections of law for the State D.O.T than for other government entities (including your city's Dept. of Transportation).

In general, your landlord can break the lease before it ends if it's not their fault that the premises are unavailable because a government entity has forced them to sell the property for demolition.

I'm not sure what the DOT employees are saying about not being able to get in touch with you.   They certainly know the address of the property they are condemning and can employ an advanced government technique called ""knocking on the door"".  And now that you've called them, what do they have to say about the matter ? END"

","Wow, a freshly signed lease ?  No way your landlord didn't know that they were selling the building six weeks ago.

First, let's figure out precisely which agency you're dealing with.   Is it literally the North Carolina Department of Transportation, or is it your City or County ?

Keep careful written notes about any conversation you have with either party.  If you can, do your communication in writing (at least e-mail, not text messages) and every time you have a conversation on the phone, memorialize it by sending an e-mail to the person that is a ""to summarize our conversation this afternoon, September 14, 2020"".

It's possible, but unlikely, that your lease includes a condemnation clause that simply lets your landlord duck out and leaves you looking for housing.     The fact that they're being evasive suggests that they might have screwed up and not included such a clause, even though they were negotiating to sell the property.

Take a step back and evaluate what might be reasonable moving expenses, and be ready to put a specific number on ""this is how much more an equivalent apartment will cost per month if we vacate as requested"".   Be sure to include an agreement to return 100% of your security deposit in any agreement you make, since obviously they can't use it to repair a building that will be demolished. END"
" Q: An adult man (20's) has been giving/selling vapes and marijuana to my 12 year old sister and her friends
T: GOOD
B: Location: USA, North Carolina

My half-sister has had difficulty dealing with not having her father around. We share the same mother. I'm 25, and I've been like a second mother to her since she was born. My mother and I have noticed that she's been running with a bad crowd and decided to catch her off-guard and take her computer while she was still logged on. We had already confiscated her phone and put her on restriction. 

I noticed that she had her Snapchat login information saved into the browser. Like any person trying to figure out why their smart, bright young sister was skipping homework assignments and getting into trouble, I logged in, changed the password to her Snapchat so I could open the app on my phone. Sorry, that might be confusing to some of you unfamiliar with the app. 

We found vapes of various kinds in her room a few weeks ago. Mostly cheap $15 disposable ones. More than anything I wanted to get to the bottom of where she was getting these things from. To my horror, it wasn't long before I found messages from a guy named Bob. She messaged him asking if he could bring her some ""nic""

He told her that he was broke and didn't have enough gas to get all the way to our house, but she reassured him that she would pay for his gas if he came by our house first. She gave him our address. He came by our house, picked up the $30 she stole from our wallets, went to a head shop to buy the vapes, and then brought them back to her. It's all in the messages. 

This meant he was old enough to drive and was old enough to buy tobacco (21 in the US). It didn't take long for me to connect the dots between him and a conversation I had with my sister a few weeks ago about some guy that worked at a fast food chain restaurant. She said he was a creepy guy that talked to all of her friends, but primarily one named Anna (14). She brought it up in a way that made me think he was some teenager, but I was wrong. 

I immediately confronted her and she went into more detail about this creep. She confessed that she was afraid of him because he has a short temper, and her friend Anna was deeply involved with him. Apparently he picks Anna up in his van sometimes, and one of the times recently things went ""bad"" between them. Anna refused to tell my sister any more than that. Anna lives in our neighborhood, and my sister explained that part of the deal was that she gave Anna one of the vapes he dropped off. 

My sister explained that since he's an alcoholic and works in fast food, he's broke and has a group of young girls and boys he threatens for these vapes so they get them any way possible. He'll take the vapes from them and give them to Anna and her younger sister because he has a crush on both of them and wants to control them. He also gives them marijuana. He has mentioned to these girls that he thinks age is just a number.

I confronted him as soon as I saw those messages, and maybe I shouldn't have. I was so upset though. I called him a loser for getting gas money from a 12 year old girl. I told him never to contact her again. I plan on deleting that Snapchat profile anyways, but I'm keeping it as long as I need to for evidence. 

I plan on going to the authorities, but I realistically wanted to know what would happen. I have one of the vapes he gave her, the messages from his Snapchat profile to her, and I know where he works. 

My sister agreed to answer any questions the police may have regarding him. I know when his shifts are, so I planned on waiting for him to drive in tomorrow so I could get his plate number. I don't know his last name. I feel so helpless. 

If the authorities are no help, I want to go into the restaurant and speak with his manager when he's not there. I know they can't really do anything to him legally, but it might make me feel better knowing that they know what a creep he is. 

Do I need more to get the attention of police?

" Q: My school lost an item irreplaceable to me while moving my belongings from my dorm over the summer without my consent. (Florida)
T: GOOD
B: After spring break, my school decided that classes would shift from in-person to online, and that students were to move out. Initially, my school informed us that we had until April 19th to retrieve our belongings from our dorms. I arranged plans to retrieve my belongings before this date, but on April 1st there was a state-order to stay in place, and students (myself included) were told that we would not be able to retrieve our belongings until at least May 1st. On April 17th, my school sent an email to students informing us that our belongings were being moved. This was troubling to me, because I knew that I had things in my dorm that were irreplaceable to me, especially a pillow that was made by my dad who died when I was 15. I emailed them the same day expressing that I would not like my belongings touched at all. They plainly ignored this, saying they need to move belongings, and informing me that I would be contacted later on as to where I could retrieve my items. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I’ve moved back into a new dorm, after having retrieved what I thought was all my belongings on May 4th, and I realize that my pillow made by my dad is missing. I email my school’s housing department, explaining my previous room and the details of my missing pillow. I did not receive a reply until 2 days ago, Friday, and only after pestering them several times that I had not even been acknowledged. I was informed that the housing department has not found my pillow in their storage areas or any other boxes labeled for my room, and that they will exhaust all search possibilities in another attempt tomorrow, Monday. 

Needless to say I am enraged at the carelessness they’ve shown with misplacing my belonging, but what’s more I suspect that my pillow has been thrown away, as most mattress pads (including my own) were not returned and were thrown away. I would like to know if I have any options for finding compensation from my school if my priceless item was lost, and especially if it was disposed of without consultation or even notification.

###

","I am sorry.  There is no way to quantify sentimental value and most disputes over damaged or lost property use fair market or retail replacement value.  There is no accounting for, or acknowledgement of, sentimental value,

" Q: Austin Tx car dealer scammed me. Never gave me title, then went out of business. I'm military; trying to register in Nevada. DTP suit pending, but can I get legal help fighting DMV issues?
T: GOOD
B: *This post is a bit used-car heavy, but please see my specific legal questions near the bottom of the thread. \[Cross-posted in* [r/askcarsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/), r/Austin and r/DMV\]

*TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. Scroll to bolded text near the bottom for questions.*

* Bought used car in Feb 2020. Dealership is in Austin, TX, but I'm not a Texas resident. (I'm military temporarily serving in Texas, but intend to register vehicle in Nevada.) Dealership didn't have title because they ""just got the car in, but title is coming and we'll send it to the Nevada DMV ASAP."" I foolishly fell for it. My bank (USAA) paid them directly, and now I repay the loan monthly to USAA. I do have a bill of sale, and other related paperwork from the transaction (we-owe, odometer statement, etc,) ... just no title.
* I kept pinging the dealership about title/registration. They avoided me for a few weeks, saying ""we're working it,"" but eventually they just decide to ghost me. (I don't live in Austin ... Visiting in person wasn't an easy option.)
* I call USAA for help. They won't clawback the loan to allow me to take the car back. (Besides, dealership isn't obligated to take car back anyway.) USAA's stance is: They gave the money to me, not the dealership (even though they LITERALLY gave the money directly to the dealership.) I'm making monthly payments to USAA on a car I don't have a title for, even while USAA sends me periodic letters harassing me because they don't have the title for the loan (as the lienholder.)
* Months go by. The temp plates the dealership gave me are expired. (Luckily, COVID-19 has caused some cities to issue waivers for expired registration, so I'm safe for now. But once the waiver expires, I won't have registration, nor temp tags.) I can purchase one 30-day tag from the DMV, but once it expires, I'll still be without registration, and the rules only allow ONE purchase of a temp tag. (I can't buy them multiple times back-to-back.)
* I got a lawyer and also filed a complaint with Texas DMV Dealership Enforcement division. Texas Attorney General was not interested in helping; deferred to DMV. BBB is worthless. Military lawyers don't work these issues.
* DMV investigator says dealership was not on the level, with multiple people having the same issue. The dealership acquired cars, but didn't make good on the titles. (I don't know exactly what this means ... Maybe the dealership financed the cars from an auction but didn't pay the auction house they bought them from?) Whatever the reason, the dealership was selling cars they knew they couldn't deliver titles on.

(FYI: The car itself is fine. Carfax is clean, it's not salvaged; I had the car inspected before purchase, and I've been driving it since Feb, even took a cross-country road trip with no problems. I have no problems with the car itself, other than I can't register it because I don't have title.)

* DMV investigator tells me the dealership is going out of business. (I guess they're pulling out out now before more people sue.) They weren't responsive to me anyway ... but now this means I have no hope of getting the dealership to make things right.
* Lawyer files suit for Deceptive Trade Practices. (I'm still waiting for this to play out, but with dealer going out of business, I'm not expecting much to result from this. Maybe I win a default judgement that I can't collect.)

I go to DMV to research options.

* I can't request ""duplicate title,"" because duplicate titles are for when the CURRENT owner needs a copy of the current title s/he once had. (Since I never had the title in my name, I have no proof that I'm the current owner and can't request a duplicate.)
* I research a ""bonded title,"" and learn that I could purchase a surety bond. This would allow me to get a bonded title, and register the car in Texas, but not Nevada. But, I also learn that in the event that someone else lays claim to the vehicle (say, the dealership, or the auction house that the dealer never paid,) then the bond will pay the previous claimant and I'd be required to repay the bondsman (while STILL replaying my USAA loan.) This would effectively make me financially liable for TWICE what I was expecting to pay for the car.
* I complete a TX DMV form VTR-130 ""Notice of Determination for a Bonded Title,"" and the DMV annotates that there is no lien on the vehicle. I'm supposed to use this to purchase a surety bond, but I'm holding off for now, because I'm not sure I want to do this. Lawyer also advises me to hold off going this route in hopes other solutions arise.

My concern is that SOMEONE (either the auction house where the dealer got the car, or the dealer themselves) will claim to be the rightful owner, forcing me to repay the bond.

* I was able to track down the previous owner, who says he traded in the vehicle to ""Covert Autogroup"" dealership in Dec 2019. Since I bought the car in Feb 2020, this leaves about two months where Covert must've sold the car to either the dealership or an auction. I've tried calling Covert twice ... I can't easily go there in person, and each time I call and ask for the finance/title dept, I get transferred to a voicemail that is unanswered. (Even if I was to reach a human, I doubt they will help me anyway.)

I assume there's a *reason* the dealer didn't give me a title, and I need to pinpoint who might claim ownership of the car. I think I need to find who the dealer purchased the car from, and somehow get proof that they no longer have an interest in the vehicle (or, at least confirm that they DO have an interest in the vehicle, which will confirm my suspicion that I shouldn't buy a surety bond.)

***My general questions, in bold:***

If Covert Autogroup (who accepted the car from the previous owner as a trade-in) isn't responsive, ***how can I find out who the dealer bought the car from?*** (Carfax shows that a title was issued/update in Jan 2020, but has no info about to whom.)

If I FIND them, ***WHAT exactly am I asking them to do that will make things right?*** Sign some form? Give me a letter of release of interest?

If I choose to move forward with a bonded title, remember that I'm military and intended to register in Nevada ... Nevada won't accept bonded titles for out-of-state registrations, and I understand Texas won't allow transfers of bonded titles out of state. I'm not a TX resident, but I guess I could attempt to register in Texas and that might work for a bit. But I'm soon scheduled to leave Texas (for my next duty assignment,) and will no longer be physically in the state for the required 3-5 years a bonded title needs to be maintained. My driver's license and insurance are with my home state of Nevada ... ***Should I attempt to register in Texas if I'm not a resident, won't be in the state, and have no intention of returning to Texas? If Nevada won't accept a bonded title, I'm not sure how else I can register.***

***Finally, if I'm tired of fighting, how can I just wash my hands of this?*** If:

* ... I'm willing to concede there is no acceptable resolution;
* ... if I don't want to risk getting a bonded title and having to repay the surety bond and be liable for twice the amount of the car;
* ... if I can't register in Nevada with a bonded title;
* ... if I shouldn't register in Texas because I'm not a resident and won't be in the state for the 3-year bonded title requirement;
* ... if my lawsuit results in default judgement I can't collect from a bankrupt dealership;
* ... if I'm willing to repay USAA the auto loan anyway ...

... What can I do with the car? I assume I can't sell a car I don't appear to legally own, yet it's a perfectly fine car. (And, if I had a bonded title, I assume no one would want to buy it anyway.) ***My end goal is to prove ownership of the car and register it in my home state of Nevada. If I can't do this under my current circumstances, what's the right way to just eat the losses and move on?***

My legal questions:

Based on multiple reports from at least 30 other victims who got scammed by the same dealership, I believe the dealership intentionally sold cars they knew they couldn't provide title to. They took me for $25k (through my bank,) and I didn't get what I paid for (a car WITH title.) ***Why does no one seem to think this is a crime?*** I called the police, my bank, the Texas DMV, the TX Attorney General, etc. While everyone agrees its a messed up situation, no one seems to be concerned that they're doing this. ***Is this NOT a crime?***

While I do have a lawyer who's working a DTP lawsuit, it was REALLY hard to find him. Most lawyers wouldn't touch my case, I assume because there wasn't enough money in it for them. Additionally, he warns that he is only focused on the DTP and can't/won't help with my DMV/registration issues. ***With both Texas and Nevada's rules limiting my ability to register a car I purchased legally, what legal assistance can I hire to help me navigate this?***

TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. DTP suit pending, but can't find legal help wading through DMV issues.

","While the military's Judge Advocates and the like might not deal with this there certainly are offices and organizations within your command that do. Start by talking to your superiors and keep bumping up the chain of command until you find someone who can help or knows who can.

If that doesn't prove effective and the Attorney General even is unresponsive there's always your state and federal representatives. They love to meddle in the affairs of mere mortals and this sounds like something on of them whispering, or yelling, in the right ear could get fast-tracked to resolution. Especially since they'd get to tally it as a win for a service member. END"

","The situation from the car dealership’s perspective is basically this most likely:

They sell cars that are effectively financed to them by the floor-plan company. When the sell more cars, they pay off the old cars on the floor-plan and those titles get released to the buyers of the car. 

At first this is immediately. Then, the dealership gets a couple days behind which isn’t a huge deal. Eventually, it spirals out of control and the money coming in isn’t enough to pay off the floor-plans on the old cars and the dealer can’t release the titles because they can’t afford to get them from the floor-plan company. 

Covid-19 stopped dealers from being able to sell cars for 2-3 months in many places and forced them out of business because this flow of money stopped. With no money coming in, there was no way to pay off the last cars sold with the floor-plan company. 

The dealership isn’t trying to screw you over. The owner at this point is probably just trying his/her best to stay out of jail and not lose their house.

I don’t know what to tell you from a legal perspective of getting the title, but this is a very common problem right now across the country due to Covid and certainly not a dealer trying to scam you.

Chances are the floor-plan company (probably the auction house the car was last sold at) has the title. You may have luck getting a hold of someone there and trying to gather more information from them. You could also try again to contact the former owner of the dealership, it’s possible if you approach it in a friendly non-legal action threatening manner they will be honest with you about the situation and it may help you sort it out.

My legal questions:

They took me for $25k (through my bank,) and I didn't get what I paid for (a car WITH title.) ***Why does no one seem to think this is a crime?*** I called the police, my bank, the Texas DMV, the TX Attorney General, etc. While everyone agrees its a messed up situation, no one seems to be concerned that they're doing this. ***Is this NOT a crime?***

While I do have a lawyer who's working a DTP lawsuit, it was REALLY hard to find him. Most lawyers wouldn't touch my case, I assume because there wasn't enough money in it for them. Additionally, he warns that he is only focused on the DTP and can't/won't help with my DMV/registration issues. ***With both Texas and Nevada's rules limiting my ability to register a car I purchased legally, what legal assistance can I hire to help me navigate this?***

TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. DTP suit pending, but can't find legal help wading through DMV issues.

","Will certainly try to reach state/federal representatives, but because I'm a Nevada resident currently serving in Texas, I expect Texas will say: ""You're not my constituency, contact Nevada."" And, Nevada will say: ""You're not here, you need to deal locally with the folks in Texas.""

But, still, I'll give it a shot.

" Q: Austin Tx car dealer scammed me. Never gave me title, then went out of business. I'm military; trying to register in Nevada. DTP suit pending, but can I get legal help fighting DMV issues?
T: BAD
B: *This post is a bit used-car heavy, but please see my specific legal questions near the bottom of the thread. \[Cross-posted in* [r/askcarsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/), r/Austin and r/DMV\]

*TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. Scroll to bolded text near the bottom for questions.*

* Bought used car in Feb 2020. Dealership is in Austin, TX, but I'm not a Texas resident. (I'm military temporarily serving in Texas, but intend to register vehicle in Nevada.) Dealership didn't have title because they ""just got the car in, but title is coming and we'll send it to the Nevada DMV ASAP."" I foolishly fell for it. My bank (USAA) paid them directly, and now I repay the loan monthly to USAA. I do have a bill of sale, and other related paperwork from the transaction (we-owe, odometer statement, etc,) ... just no title.
* I kept pinging the dealership about title/registration. They avoided me for a few weeks, saying ""we're working it,"" but eventually they just decide to ghost me. (I don't live in Austin ... Visiting in person wasn't an easy option.)
* I call USAA for help. They won't clawback the loan to allow me to take the car back. (Besides, dealership isn't obligated to take car back anyway.) USAA's stance is: They gave the money to me, not the dealership (even though they LITERALLY gave the money directly to the dealership.) I'm making monthly payments to USAA on a car I don't have a title for, even while USAA sends me periodic letters harassing me because they don't have the title for the loan (as the lienholder.)
* Months go by. The temp plates the dealership gave me are expired. (Luckily, COVID-19 has caused some cities to issue waivers for expired registration, so I'm safe for now. But once the waiver expires, I won't have registration, nor temp tags.) I can purchase one 30-day tag from the DMV, but once it expires, I'll still be without registration, and the rules only allow ONE purchase of a temp tag. (I can't buy them multiple times back-to-back.)
* I got a lawyer and also filed a complaint with Texas DMV Dealership Enforcement division. Texas Attorney General was not interested in helping; deferred to DMV. BBB is worthless. Military lawyers don't work these issues.
* DMV investigator says dealership was not on the level, with multiple people having the same issue. The dealership acquired cars, but didn't make good on the titles. (I don't know exactly what this means ... Maybe the dealership financed the cars from an auction but didn't pay the auction house they bought them from?) Whatever the reason, the dealership was selling cars they knew they couldn't deliver titles on.

(FYI: The car itself is fine. Carfax is clean, it's not salvaged; I had the car inspected before purchase, and I've been driving it since Feb, even took a cross-country road trip with no problems. I have no problems with the car itself, other than I can't register it because I don't have title.)

* DMV investigator tells me the dealership is going out of business. (I guess they're pulling out out now before more people sue.) They weren't responsive to me anyway ... but now this means I have no hope of getting the dealership to make things right.
* Lawyer files suit for Deceptive Trade Practices. (I'm still waiting for this to play out, but with dealer going out of business, I'm not expecting much to result from this. Maybe I win a default judgement that I can't collect.)

I go to DMV to research options.

* I can't request ""duplicate title,"" because duplicate titles are for when the CURRENT owner needs a copy of the current title s/he once had. (Since I never had the title in my name, I have no proof that I'm the current owner and can't request a duplicate.)
* I research a ""bonded title,"" and learn that I could purchase a surety bond. This would allow me to get a bonded title, and register the car in Texas, but not Nevada. But, I also learn that in the event that someone else lays claim to the vehicle (say, the dealership, or the auction house that the dealer never paid,) then the bond will pay the previous claimant and I'd be required to repay the bondsman (while STILL replaying my USAA loan.) This would effectively make me financially liable for TWICE what I was expecting to pay for the car.
* I complete a TX DMV form VTR-130 ""Notice of Determination for a Bonded Title,"" and the DMV annotates that there is no lien on the vehicle. I'm supposed to use this to purchase a surety bond, but I'm holding off for now, because I'm not sure I want to do this. Lawyer also advises me to hold off going this route in hopes other solutions arise.

My concern is that SOMEONE (either the auction house where the dealer got the car, or the dealer themselves) will claim to be the rightful owner, forcing me to repay the bond.

* I was able to track down the previous owner, who says he traded in the vehicle to ""Covert Autogroup"" dealership in Dec 2019. Since I bought the car in Feb 2020, this leaves about two months where Covert must've sold the car to either the dealership or an auction. I've tried calling Covert twice ... I can't easily go there in person, and each time I call and ask for the finance/title dept, I get transferred to a voicemail that is unanswered. (Even if I was to reach a human, I doubt they will help me anyway.)

I assume there's a *reason* the dealer didn't give me a title, and I need to pinpoint who might claim ownership of the car. I think I need to find who the dealer purchased the car from, and somehow get proof that they no longer have an interest in the vehicle (or, at least confirm that they DO have an interest in the vehicle, which will confirm my suspicion that I shouldn't buy a surety bond.)

***My general questions, in bold:***

If Covert Autogroup (who accepted the car from the previous owner as a trade-in) isn't responsive, ***how can I find out who the dealer bought the car from?*** (Carfax shows that a title was issued/update in Jan 2020, but has no info about to whom.)

If I FIND them, ***WHAT exactly am I asking them to do that will make things right?*** Sign some form? Give me a letter of release of interest?

If I choose to move forward with a bonded title, remember that I'm military and intended to register in Nevada ... Nevada won't accept bonded titles for out-of-state registrations, and I understand Texas won't allow transfers of bonded titles out of state. I'm not a TX resident, but I guess I could attempt to register in Texas and that might work for a bit. But I'm soon scheduled to leave Texas (for my next duty assignment,) and will no longer be physically in the state for the required 3-5 years a bonded title needs to be maintained. My driver's license and insurance are with my home state of Nevada ... ***Should I attempt to register in Texas if I'm not a resident, won't be in the state, and have no intention of returning to Texas? If Nevada won't accept a bonded title, I'm not sure how else I can register.***

***Finally, if I'm tired of fighting, how can I just wash my hands of this?*** If:

* ... I'm willing to concede there is no acceptable resolution;
* ... if I don't want to risk getting a bonded title and having to repay the surety bond and be liable for twice the amount of the car;
* ... if I can't register in Nevada with a bonded title;
* ... if I shouldn't register in Texas because I'm not a resident and won't be in the state for the 3-year bonded title requirement;
* ... if my lawsuit results in default judgement I can't collect from a bankrupt dealership;
* ... if I'm willing to repay USAA the auto loan anyway ...

... What can I do with the car? I assume I can't sell a car I don't appear to legally own, yet it's a perfectly fine car.

" Q: 3 young women feeling taken advantage of in NYC / Just moved in and apartment renovations incomplete
T: GOOD
B: We moved in Sep 1 and were told the kitchen renovations would be completed by Sep 1, with a rider in our lease stating the washing machine would be installed by Sep 10. 

It is now Sep 13 and while the stove has been connected, we still have no countertops (just open cabinetry) no kitchen sink and no washing machine. We are making do with the fridge/stove and bathroom sink. Our landlord offered us $500 off our rent, but that seems like not enough, given our total rent for our 4BR is $4500/month. He also enters without giving us advance warning, which I thought wasn’t allowed. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated!

###

","Hold up a second. Take a step back and breathe. Yes, this is incredibly frustrating. I’m sorry it happened. But I don’t think things are as bad as you may be thinking they are.

It sounds like work is still progressing. Which is good. It means your landlord intends to complete the work and is actively working towards it. 

And then there’s the $500 off. Given it’s been 2 weeks, that’s $1,000/mo. Which is a pretty sizable and reasonable discount. They wouldn’t be offering this is their intention was to screw you over.

Yes, they are likely required to provide the kitchen re: habitability; however, they would also be given a reasonable period of time to remedy. (And offering to reduce/discount your rent helps their case too).

Your lease likely has a clause in it that said that if they were unable to deliver, they could keep you out and prorate for a month. So, by comparison, is it better having no kitchen and reduced rent for a month? Or would you rather they have pushed your move in back a month at the start? Again, sounds like they are at least trying (or maybe they just wanted the money).

My advice? Sit down with the landlord and work out a schedule for completion. Don’t push them for quicker results, just emphasize getting a real and firm timeline that you can hold them to. Discuss work hours and notification for unit access re: work. Ask that the $500 be at a rate of $1,000 per month paid biweekly until work is completed. (They’ll push back on this, that’s fine, just require a monthly concession until work is completed so that they’re incentivized to finish).

Once everything is settled, send an e-mail memorializing everything and ask for a reply to confirm receipt/understanding. From there, hold them to it. If they miss more deadlines, then you can demand more or go to court.

As a practical matter, there are also door stops you can install which prevent the door from being opened while you are home. These are cheap, don’t damage anything, and force LL to notify you before entering while you are home.

Hope this helps! END"

","The good news is there doesn't seem to be any indication that your LL is purposefully acting in bad faith. 

In terms of him randomly entering without advance warning- Landlords are allowed to enter by giving a reasonable notice under certain circumstances and one of those is to provide necessary or agreed upon services. You should have a chat with him and just let him know to give you guys a heads up that he's coming in for needed services and thereafter a 24 hour notice. 

Sometimes landlords just need a kick in the ass and showing him that you know your rights will often set them straight pretty quick. END"

" Q: [Texas] Peeping Tom that won’t leave us alone.
T: GOOD
B: My roommate and I just moved into our dream (rental) house. We’ve been here about two months now, and our neighbor seemed friendly at first. 

He’s older, maybe 60? And lives right next door. Our first encounter with him was when we were viewing the home - he looked through the fence and introduced himself, talking about how he was friends with the old owner and still has a key to the home. 

We haven’t interacted much with him, but he is always around outside. The dog hates him and will bark incessantly when he’s outside or along the fence, but truly doesn’t bark at anything or anyone else. The dog barks a lot nowadays, but still, only at him. 

Our landlord did not rekey the home for us when we moved in, but recently has due to the events of last week. 

Tuesday night, 11/10, I was in Austin for work and my roommate called me at 9 pm freaking out saying that she’s called the police. She fell asleep on the couch and woke up to the dog barking viciously at the window across from the couch. Our neighbor was standing at the window looking in, watching her sleep. 

The police came and talked to him. They also retrieved a step stool from below the window that the neighbor automatically claimed to be his. 

We filed a report and the police asked for the key to the house - he gave them a bunk key that doesn’t fit any of our locks. Thankfully the landlord has since listened to our plea to change the locks and did the next day. The guy has creeped us out from day one. Really. 

However, now he won’t leave us alone. He will knock on our door for 5-10 minutes at a time multiple times a day. He also wrote us a three page letter and taped it to our door. We have added that to the police report. 

Is there anything else we can do aside from a security system/cameras to keep him away from us and off our property?

" Q: [Texas] Peeping Tom that won’t leave us alone.
T: GOOD
B: My roommate and I just moved into our dream (rental) house. We’ve been here about two months now, and our neighbor seemed friendly at first. 

He’s older, maybe 60? And lives right next door. Our first encounter with him was when we were viewing the home - he looked through the fence and introduced himself, talking about how he was friends with the old owner and still has a key to the home. 

We haven’t interacted much with him, but he is always around outside. The dog hates him and will bark incessantly when he’s outside or along the fence, but truly doesn’t bark at anything or anyone else. The dog barks a lot nowadays, but still, only at him. 

Our landlord did not rekey the home for us when we moved in, but recently has due to the events of last week. 

Tuesday night, 11/10, I was in Austin for work and my roommate called me at 9 pm freaking out saying that she’s called the police. She fell asleep on the couch and woke up to the dog barking viciously at the window across from the couch. Our neighbor was standing at the window looking in, watching her sleep. 

The police came and talked to him. They also retrieved a step stool from below the window that the neighbor automatically claimed to be his. 

We filed a report and the police asked for the key to the house - he gave them a bunk key that doesn’t fit any of our locks. Thankfully the landlord has since listened to our plea to change the locks and did the next day. The guy has creeped us out from day one. Really.

","This, and don't acknowledge him whatsoever, even to tell him to stay away from you. People who stalk others are reinforced when you pay attention to them, even when its negative attention. It's a power game. The second you react or acknowledge, it gives them the rush they're looking for and it's an encouragement to continue. Easier said than done, but involve the police each and every time instead of telling him to stay away. He already knows he's unwanted. Invest in some privacy curtains. Get security cameras. Try to vary your schedule so it's not predictable. I'm so sorry this is happening to you and it's not right that you have to adjust how you live your life, but it's a necessary evil when dealing with people like this. When you don't give them that satisfaction they're looking for, their behaviors may get worse before they get better. But the second you pay attention or react, it's like starting at square one again and it negates all the time you previously went not acknowledging everything. END"

" Q: I shot and killed an attacking dog, what next? (North Carolina)
T: GOOD
B:  Yesterday evening I was leaving my house to walk my dog when I was attacked by 2 large pit bulls in my driveway. As they charged at me I yelled ""someone come get your dogs!"", but nobody came to help. I received a quick snap on my arm, but was wearing long sleeves and suffered no broken skin or real injury. My dog was bit up some, but nothing too serious.

Although the attacking dogs seemed more interested in killing my dog than hurting me I was in fear of serious injury, especially because the \~160 pounds of dogfight at my feet was knocking me off balance into my car, and if I fell I would be very vulnerable to being bitten on the head or neck.

I was able to draw my legally carried handgun and shoot the larger and more aggressive dog once. After the shot, both dogs stopped attacking and ran off. My dog and I went back inside, where I made sure neither of us were seriously injured, and called 911. I went back outside while on the phone with the dispatcher to search my yard and my neighbors' yards to try to render aid to the dog if possible. A neighbor ran around the corner asking ""was that a gunshot?"" and ""where are my dogs?"" I pointed the direction the dogs ran and told her where they went, but didn't say anything about the gunshot. My gun was still on my hip, and emotions were clearly high for everyone, so I didn't want to be in a conversation with an angry dog owner about why I shot her dog.

An animal control deputy (in my county they are actually sworn LEOs who work for the Sheriff) responded to the call, asked for a written report, and took photos showing the saliva left on my sleeve from the bite. As I was in the driveway speaking to the deputy the woman drove up and yelled at me, asking why I shot her dog. The deputy took the woman's information and told her to get the dog to the vet. The deputy told me that the shooting was, as far as his criminal investigation goes, entirely justified and that he would be filing his report as a response to a ""dangerous/potentially dangerous domestic animal.""

The deputy called me a few hours later to tell me that the dog had, unfortunately, died. He told me that that doesn't change anything in regards to his investigation, but to be aware that the owner could attempt to file for warrants herself or sue me.

TLDR- Got attacked by 2 dogs in my driveway, felt that I was in danger of having my face eaten, shot and killed one of the dogs.

Sorry for the long rambling post, but what do I need to do to protect myself here?

Thanks

","First and foremost document document document.
You said your dog was bitten? Take your dog to the vet and get a written statement from them of what they see.  Take pictures, as many pictures as you can, and get a copy of the police report.

","In addition to what others have said:

Get your dog to the vet, even minor injuries should be documented for legal purposes. But also dog bites can be deceptive: they're puncture wounds of course so they can look insignificant but can become infected easily. So as a precaution, take your dog to the vet. 

If you had ANY broken skin, to the doctor you go. I know it feels silly for just a little scratch or a single toothmark but you want to make sure there's a record by a neutral 3rd party.  And same thing: dog mouths aren't very clean, it's far easier to take some preventative antibiotics than it is to get septicemia and have to sue her for damages later. 

You may not know if these dogs are current on vaccines, it's important to be careful. The officer may have included in the report whether he confirmed rabies vaccs with her vet. Get the report. 

Look or ask the homes with a line of sight to the location this happened (even if its way down the block): do any of your neighbors have Ring doorbells or security cameras? If you can get any video of the incident that would be excellent. 

Sounds like you have a pretty good case for self defense against the dog. I'm sorry it came to that, certainly as a dog owner yourself that doesn't feel good. But you had to protect yourself. Sounds like you did the right thing. END"

","You asked one question. ""How long did all of this take?""

Then you made several statements and assumptions.

Also, yes, gun owners are expected to be responsible. That is why there is an extensive background process to even acquire one, with even more training to legally carry one in public.

Like it or not pitbulls are not a fightning breed, nor does history reflect that they are. You are mistaking the behavior of humans on animals for the innate behavior of the animal. Pitbulls are much sweeter than most small dog breeds and are loyal and protective to their families to the death.

If you decide to take the unfortunate and despicable realities that have been forced upon many pits with terrible owners, then you are misprepresenting an entire species based upon the actions of their owners.

In America we presume innocence until proven guilty. The OP is asking for advice to protect themselves and being entirely candid with the whole situation. END"

T: GOOD
B: I'm in Arizona. My (44F) husband (49M) blindsided me yesterday by stating he wants to separate but stay in same home (separate bedrooms). We will have been married 22 years next month. There have been no major issues, although he has been stressed and easy to anger over the last couple of years. He has worked in a high-paying law enforcement job most of our marriage and I have tried to make his home life easy to accommodate for his shift changes, stressful work, etc. That's beside the point. He stated the reason for the separation is because we are on different paths due to opposite interests and he does not see that changing. He said he did not consider divorce because of the kids (16F and 13M) and finances. He literally said he doesn't want to lose half of what he has worked most of his life for - his retirement. The talk yesterday was mostly one-sided because I was stunned. The kids and I have walked on eggshells for years to keep him happy, and this is how I am rewarded. Oh, I also work full-time, but I bring in less than half each month what he does. 
After gathering myself over 24 hours, I asked what the goal of separation is if he does not see anything changing with our ""different paths."" He said he thought I understood the intention is to divorce. But he wants to wait until we pay off a consolidation loan in May. It sounds like his intention is to wait as long as possible to file for divorce. 

My concern and question is: if I let him wait, will he get a more favorable financial settlement regarding his retirement if he retires before the divorce is final? Also, he does not have to retire. He just wants to and is retiring as soon as he can. He plans to get another job, but the job he plans to get will be a contract position - no insurance, not a regular salary.
I plan to find an attorney to have a consultation ASAP, but I am just hoping to see if I am being too suspicious. As a bonus, I did discover that he has been communicating daily with another woman. But that's for another sub.

","Call a divorce lawyer.

Your husband might be trying to wait until he retires, get a few months of zero income to his name and THEN file for divorce and say ""I can't pay child support, and I can't pay alimony, I have no income.""

It might be better for you to force the issue now and file for divorce while he has a high income. And then if he tells the judge ""But I plan to retire"" the judge might say ""Plans change. I order you to support your ex-wife and kids.""

Also, his desire that you both keep living in the same house (which may make you miserable) may be financial too.

Thankfully, I'll have a few years to get my affairs in order, but I have some major debts that likely will continue. I want to make to minimize the stress on my spouse after my death regarding finances (which is probably all I can help alleviate).

I have federal and private student loans (prior to marriage) as well as a little credit card debt in my name alone (tbh, credit cards will probably be paid completely prior to my death-it's not a large amount at all). I read that federal student loans and credit cards in my name only will be cancelled, but can vary on state law. Is this true in Indiana? What about private student loans? Does it matter if I got the private loans prior to marriage?

He is a cosigner on our mortgage, so I know he'll be left with that, but I do have life insurance that should pay off the rest of the mortgage for him, and set aside some money to help with counseling or something. Should I pursue life insurance to cover the other debts? Or would that be in bad faith at this point?

","As someone who went through a similar situation with my mom and dad, sell everything you own to a third party that you trust, or even transfer it into a trust in his name only. Selling to him or transferring to him could cause fraud headaches later on once you're passed. What will happen (at least in my experience in Colorado) is even debts that are not considered joint debts will attempt to be paid off via anything that you own (house, cars, boats, collections of obscure things etc) selling or transferring ownership of these things to him can raise some huge red flags in regards to fraud. Another potential option would be instead of transferring anything, get divorced and in your annulment agreement claim what debts are to be yours in order to get a court order that says he is not responsible for said debts. Now I know you mentioned earlier youre in a common law state which would mean if you continue to live together, you would need to be very careful to avoid any sort of common law marriage clause from taking effect (ie calling each other your spouse) but looking into it further and finding what defines common law marriage in your state would be wildly important for this path.

","It is still your debt/your property and so it can absolutely be levied against, or have a lien placed on it. Now... Some creditors won't do this sort of thing, but it honestly is more of a hassle than it's worth. My recommendation, and I see you already are on it, is find an estate lawyer to help you split things apart to prevent the headache for him. Sorry to speak so frankly about it, I can't imagine how hard this is for you, but it is deff something you need to deal with before it becomes a problem. As well, just something to keep in mind, if you are able to completely separate everything, any amount you would put towards said debt, instead (personally I) would set it aside in cold cash/in a bank in his name, to assist in everything after.

" Q: My Mom was exposed to COVID by a doctor who came in while sick. The doctor performed surgeries while positive with COVID, is there anything I can do?
T: GOOD
B: Hi everyone,

This is a little long so I apologize, i'm also on a throwaway account. I got a call from my mom (60F, lives in PA) today and she told me that she was exposed to COVID-19 by one of the doctors that she works with. The doctor had come into work with a fever claiming that it was a sinus infection. Three days later he tested positive for COVID-19 and my mom was made aware of the possible exposure by her manager after the doctor tested positive. She is quarantining without pay, and the office that she works for told her she can use her PTO time but will otherwise be unpaid.

She was exposed while eating lunch in their break room. She was not wearing a mask (because she was eating lunch) and the doctor was also in the room with her. Long story short, not only was he maskless, but he decided to eat off her directly off my mothers plate without her permission. My mother was tested but we're still waiting on results.

On top of that, the doctor was seeing patients and **performing surgeries on patients** **while sick.** When my mom told me that I just couldn't believe it. After our conversation I couldn't stop thinking about all of the people who were potentially exposed and further unknowingly exposing their loved ones at home. I called her back and we filed a COVID complaint form in the state that she lives in anonymously because she is terrified of losing her job over this.

The doctors office is not closed down, and the doctor plans on returning to the office this week which is a week earlier than is safe to go back after testing positive. The office did not close down, and did not properly sanitize after finding out that the doctor tested positive. Who knows how many people have been exposed in that office.

My question is, is there anything else we can or should do? I'm worried that the office will continue BAU and the doctor will return potentially exposing more patients and other nurses. I don't know how timely the complaints are addressed, and I can't stop thinking about people potentially getting exposed.  I'm angry that a doctor would go to work with a fever during a pandemic and put my mother, patients, nurses, others at risk. I'm not sure if we should wait it out and see if anything comes of the complaint, or if there is another place we can file a complaint against the doctor and the office.

###

","It's not possible to prove she got COVID from that doctor. That's an unprovable allegation. All of us, no matter how careful we are, are exposed to positive people every time we leave our house.  There is a baseline level of risk during a pandemic that no amount or mitigation can completely eliminate. You can talk to a personal injury attorney but I would expect to be told the same thing.

Three days later he tested positive for COVID-19 and my mom was made aware of the possible exposure by her manager after the doctor tested positive. She is quarantining without pay, and the office that she works for told her she can use her PTO time but will otherwise be unpaid.

She was exposed while eating lunch in their break room. She was not wearing a mask (because she was eating lunch) and the doctor was also in the room with her. Long story short, not only was he maskless, but he decided to eat off her directly off my mothers plate without her permission. My mother was tested but we're still waiting on results.

On top of that, the doctor was seeing patients and **performing surgeries on patients** **while sick.** When my mom told me that I just couldn't believe it. After our conversation I couldn't stop thinking about all of the people who were potentially exposed and further unknowingly exposing their loved ones at home. I called her back and we filed a COVID complaint form in the state that she lives in anonymously because she is terrified of losing her job over this.

The doctors office is not closed down, and the doctor plans on returning to the office this week which is a week earlier than is safe to go back after testing positive. The office did not close down, and did not properly sanitize after finding out that the doctor tested positive. Who knows how many people have been exposed in that office.

My question is, is there anything else we can or should do? I'm worried that the office will continue BAU and the doctor will return potentially exposing more patients and other nurses. I don't know how timely the complaints are addressed, and I can't stop thinking about people potentially getting exposed.  I'm angry that a doctor would go to work with a fever during a pandemic and put my mother, patients, nurses, others at risk. I'm not sure if we should wait it out and see if anything comes of the complaint, or if there is another place we can file a complaint against the doctor and the office.

Or when she picked up her medicines at the pharmacy the day after.  Or daughter-in-law was an asymptomatic carrier and brought it into her home.

" Q: My downstairs neighbors won't stop calling the police to report noise complaints
T: GOOD
B: Title basically covers the issue, but to make it more clear, my sweetheart and I own an apartment on the third floor of a condo building in New Jersey. He is almost always at work and I have been traveling back and forth between here and his parents house in Connecticut, as I am a student and work to find the quietest space possible while we're all in remote learning. 

Since I've been back for the past week / week and a half, the downstairs neighbors have called the police on us twice. The first time, the police came at 12:30 in the morning, they reported that the downstairs neighbors were saying we were making loud banging noises earlier in the afternoon, but the police did not report hearing any loud noise. That afternoon, my sweetheart was nailing in some moulding around a door frame, say about three nails were put in and the hammering lasted I'd say about 15 minutes at around 2:00 p.m. This morning, the police were called again at 7:30 in the morning. My sweetheart and I were sleeping when they came so there is no possible way that we were making any noise. 

At this point, the police have issued us a written warning and an official summons, and they say that the next time they come they'll have to issue us yet another ticket. As far as I can find online the first ticket is a $250 violation and the second ticket is a $500 violation. At this point I don't know what to do, we are quiet, respectful and we don't want bad blood, but the neighbors only method of trying to resolve the situation is to call the police, and at this point we're feeling harassed. What can we do?

###

","Get statements from other neighbors about any noise or lack of noise at the times the complaints allege. Fight the ticket if/when you get one. Also check local noise ordinances. Nailing should not cause any violation. If the police came at midnight it's likely seems more likely that the noise was reported to have occurred then, which would make more sense for a violation. 

Talking with neighbors is usually better than getting courts involved, especially if you plan to be there long term. END"

","Start by going to the police station so they can't brush you off and ask to speak to the supervisor. You'll want to make clear that you don't appreciate the use of the police to harass you over non-existent noise violations, and that outside of extremes they should not be door knocking noise complaints during the day.

Be polite, but you do want to get the idea across that your downstairs neighbour is being ridiculous. This should hopefully get the police to stop giving this person this attention. You may also want to suggest they're wasting police time and resources.

As for the fines/summons (? you need to clarify what they are) you should ideally have a lawyer, but if not it's a matter of gathering evidence including statements from witnesses, compiling it in an easy to read and understand manner, finding out what ordinance was violated exactly, figuring out how you have not violated it, and presenting it in court.

","I practice criminal defense in Cook County. As I’m sure you’re aware, you could certainly talk to police and try to get this guy charged in connection with what he did to you. Depending on the nature of the allegations, he could wind up in adult court or be prosecuted in juvenile court. As other posters have indicated, an anonymous tip is not useful — the defendant has a right to confront his accusers in court. If you offered to testify on behalf of your friend, you would be known as an “other crimes” witness. This type of evidence is generally deemed admissible, especially in sex cases. One thing to ponder —if the offender knows that there are a bunch of victims lined up to testify against him, he might be more likely to plead guilty and spare everyone a trial. If you’re in Cook County, please be aware that cases can take a LONG time to resolve; it could be years before this goes to trial, if at all. You would not be alone — at least in Cook County, there is a victim witness assistance unit — staff members accompany you to court and generally guide you through the process.

" Q: [Prince William County, Virginia] Dispute brewing with the neighbors over property use and access rights
T: GOOD
B: I purchased a home approximately three months ago not knowing there was a path everyone in the neighborhood uses that cuts right through my property to a trail behind my house. This was not disclosed by the previous owner at the period of inspection. Since my family and I have been here, we have experienced people walking their dogs off-leash on our property (we have a small child, so this makes us nervous), allowing their dogs to defecate on our property and not cleaning it up, and taking the fruit off our tree in our front yard. In addition to this, we have had the trees inspected on our property by a professional, licensed arborist and they have informed us that there is at least one dead tree dangerously leaning over that path on our property. So, (1) we do not want to deal with people disrespecting our property nor, (2) the liability of someone possibly getting injured on our property.

The path appears to have been there for a quite a while and it abuts HOA common ground. Since the property line is unclear and, (talking to one of the neighbors) it has never been done before, we hired a licensed surveyor to come out and stake the property. We then requested that the HOA establish the path OFF of our property and onto their common ground (about 10' away) and allow us to put up ""no trespassing"" signs to discourage people from using our property as a conduit to that trail. They agreed and we have done that. Now it seems some of the neighbors have been inflamed, as they have been using that path for many many years, and there is talk of them getting together and asking the county to declare that portion of our property an easement to which they are entitled to continue using.

When speaking to one of our more sympathetic neighbors, he told us that the previous homeowner's father was not happy about people walking through the yard either and kept having to chase people off the property. The previous homeowner was Korean and lived here with her Korean parents. I don't think English was their first language, so some of her dad's efforts might have gotten lost in translation. We know less about the homeowner before them, but from what our next door neighbor describes, they didn't know where the property line was or had forgotten about it, and were a lot more comfortable with sharing their personal property with the neighbors anyway. We suspect they were older, better insured, and more financially secure than we are that they did not mind shouldering that kind of risk and burden.

So my question is, do the neighbors have a legal leg to stand on? Can they have our property declared an easement (it currently isn't one, we've checked), and if so, do we need to legally pursue the previous homeowner for compensation for not disclosing this issue to us during our inspection period?

ETA: So this is even more complicated than I first thought. My husband just informed me that the HOA has landscaping on either side of the path (all on our property) that they've been maintaining for many years. In other words, an encroachment. However, they would have had to apply for this and needed to ensure that whatever landscaping they established was not on anyone's property, but on common ground instead. Unfortunately, and we are trying to get the application records from our HOA to confirm, it doesn't appear that they did. Additionally, the previous homeowner that failed to disclose all of this to us is a licensed real estate agent. 

ETA 2: Since many people have suggested I just put up a fence and be done with it, that would be a goal, but as of now, the HOA covenants do not allow front yard fences. This is part of my frustration because I feel if the previous owners had been able to fence in their front yard, maybe I would never be in this position in the first place. I feel the HOA convenants prevented the previous homeowners reasonable protection from encroachments because they were never allowed to put up a fence, and the first homeowner lived here so long and was so old by the time he left, he forgot where the property line even was. Had he been allowed to put up a fence and define the property, we might have never gotten here in the first place.

###

","IANAL but from what I’ve read I find it unlikely the neighbors would have success getting an easement for the walking path if there is a newly diverted path on the HOA common property to access the trail. If they come onto your property, alert them they are trespassing and ask them to leave, then call the cops if they refuse. Post no-trespassing signs. I find it unlikely your neighbors will go to the trouble and expense to move beyond complaining and actually hire an attorney and take this to a judge, and even less likely a judge would grant an easement when an alternative route exists 10’ from the path through your property.

T: GOOD
B: In Colorado: laws have changed and in order to sell a house, the septic must be inspected. My neighbors put a rental they owned up for sale and now have a buyer. Due to the change of law, they had to have the septic inspected and are trying to update the permit from 1978. The pipes where the leech field drains were broken and they ended up digging them up and repairing them. 

Turns out these pipes and leech field run on to our property lines by about 30 feet. I noticed them digging with some large equipment last week and ran out there to let them know they were on our property. Its a large flat area and I said I didn't mind so long as the put the dirt back and flattened it out nicely, and they did. My understanding is that they were trying to figure out where it was broken. Well, I guess when they found the broken piping, they just repaired it and covered it back up.

I got a text yesterday from my neighbor asking me if I would meet him at the bank to sign and notarize an easement for use of the septic for the new buyer. I, in return, asked to see the documents first. Why wasn't I informed in the first place? There is no documentation in any of my paperwork when we bought our home about the neighbors leech field on our property. I believe this is because the permit is almost 50 years old. Either way, we should've discussed the repair and use of the easement before he made assumptions, fixed it, then covered it back up. 

Anyway, he had the land surveyed and our property lines done, and now would like an easement for septic maintenance. The documents included a map and verbiage regarding maintenance by the grantee. The terms seems pretty straight forward and not uncommon around here, but i don't want to affect the resale value of my home, and i believe this restricts the use of that area. Im a little peeved that he didn't discuss this with me in the first place as I would've asked them to just move the leech field off the property all together when they discovered the issue. Instead he just repaired it and now wants the easement. 

As of right now I haven't signed anything. I did ask him to add a claus to the document that states that in the event of failure or the need to repair the septic leech field in anyway, it must be moved completely at the cost of the neighbors.. As in, an easement is fine for now, but the second there are issues, it must be moved and the easement is void.

Am I protecting myself? Should I even allow an easement?

","One thing to consider would be to agree that it's for the existing leech field only, not new leech fields.  Depending on the use, a typical leech field only lasts 25-40 years.  They will need to move it at some point. 
Also some governments have pre-approved locations for moving leech fields. You should have the neighbors figure out where thier town/County will approve thier next leech field.  It would be good for you to make sure your property is not a part of the next leech field. END"

Anyway, he had the land surveyed and our property lines done, and now would like an easement for septic maintenance. The documents included a map and verbiage regarding maintenance by the grantee. The terms seems pretty straight forward and not uncommon around here, but i don't want to affect the resale value of my home, and i believe this restricts the use of that area. Im a little peeved that he didn't discuss this with me in the first place as I would've asked them to just move the leech field off the property all together when they discovered the issue. Instead he just repaired it and now wants the easement. 

As of right now I haven't signed anything. I did ask him to add a claus to the document that states that in the event of failure or the need to repair the septic leech field in anyway, it must be moved completely at the cost of the neighbors.. As in, an easement is fine for now, but the second there are issues, it must be moved and the easement is void.

Am I protecting myself? Should I even allow an easement?

","You need to speak to an attorney to move forward. They may be trying to get you to sign to avoid having the cost and time required to go to court and get what they could get anyway. If that's the case you signing will save you a ton of money and headache. But if that's NOT the case, then you may want to take advantage of the situation to protect yourself. You need a local real estate attorney to advise you so that you do not make an expensive mistake. And doing nothing might be an expensive mistake. Might.

" Q: Neighbor wants us to sign an easement on our property
T: BAD
B: In Colorado: laws have changed and in order to sell a house, the septic must be inspected. My neighbors put a rental they owned up for sale and now have a buyer. Due to the change of law, they had to have the septic inspected and are trying to update the permit from 1978. The pipes where the leech field drains were broken and they ended up digging them up and repairing them. 

Turns out these pipes and leech field run on to our property lines by about 30 feet. I noticed them digging with some large equipment last week and ran out there to let them know they were on our property. Its a large flat area and I said I didn't mind so long as the put the dirt back and flattened it out nicely, and they did. My understanding is that they were trying to figure out where it was broken. Well, I guess when they found the broken piping, they just repaired it and covered it back up.

I got a text yesterday from my neighbor asking me if I would meet him at the bank to sign and notarize an easement for use of the septic for the new buyer. I, in return, asked to see the documents first. Why wasn't I informed in the first place? There is no documentation in any of my paperwork when we bought our home about the neighbors leech field on our property. I believe this is because the permit is almost 50 years old. Either way, we should've discussed the repair and use of the easement before he made assumptions, fixed it, then covered it back up.

" Q: Company stole my artwork and don't know what to do
T: GOOD
B: Hey  guys - so back in October I got made redunant from my job as a graphic  designer due to covid having such a big impact on the business. I was  there for nearly 3 years.

So that  means I've been applying for jobs. One of the first jobs was a makeup  company who I won't name here - they aren't hugely well known but they  seem quite established.

I got  through to the second stage of the interview - which was designing  infographics for Amazon adverts. I was a bit hesitant about this,  knowing they could very well steal my ideas but thought I was being  paranoid, as quite often in designer roles you're asked to do this. Also  in the brief it specifically said it was just to establish our skill  set.

I looked at their existing  adverts on Amazon and they weren't particularly nice - a green back  ground with kind of pink ink splodge clip art. Their logo is  monochromatic so I thought I'd design the advert in black and white -  with diagonal split screens and close ups of either ends of the  makeupdrush (it was a duet brush so I was doing this to highlight it's  different functions). I even played with placing the photograph of the  brush diagonally to match the split screens. Anyway in the end it looked  really good (Sorry for nerdy rant).

I  sent it off and got invited to the final stage of the interview. Before  I went I noticed the design office was on an industrial estate really  far from where I live - I don't drive so that's an issue. Plus due to  covid, quite a lot of companies are letting people work from home on  some days - but they confirmed to me I'd need to be on site every day. I  also found out that they were offering quite a low wage which was  apparently non negotiable. So in the end I told them it wasn't suitable  for me and that was that.

I have another temp designer job now which suits me far better. But thats irrelevant to this story.

Anyway  this morning curiosity got the better of me and I thought I'd check if  the makeup company had updated their Ads and they have. It's pretty much  identical to what I'd send them - the monochrome palate, diagonal split  screen and even the brush placement. They've did it in such a way that  it's JUST different enough from mines that I probably can't do anything  but also it's SO FAR from what they had before that's it's blatantly  emulating what I sent them. I'm upset because they've essentially fully  rebranded their adverts based on a concept I sent them and I haven't  been paid anything. Plus they said they weren't going to do this? I've now emailed them with screenshots as it's so blatant they won't be able to deny it. But the fact is they are now using my design/concept to earn money and I haven't been paid a penny. What should I do?

But you're happy to sell them the full rights for the amount of your invoice. You can also file a DMCA takedown notice with Amazon. I'd probably not do that right off the bat though, I'd give them a chance to pay. 

And in the future at least get an email confirming that if they do use your design but you're not hired, they will pay you. END"

" Q: An off duty police officer found my information using my license plate. Then proceeded to hunt me down on facebook. This is illegal right?
T: GOOD
B: So I work for the city assessor taking photographs of homes strictly for property records. To preface this situation the homeowners received a letter in the mail mid October stating that someone will be on your property taking 2 photographs of the exterior of the house, they will knock or ring the doorbell first and if there is no answer then proceed to take the photographs. If the homeowner had any problems they would call.

Anyways, that leads us to today when I received a message through Facebook from a stranger asking ""Is there any reason you would be walking around taking pictures of homes?"". Immediately I was shocked and also concerned because I had no idea who this was and how they found my name. I told them I work for the city and gave them a number to call if they had any issues, also stating that I am uncomfortable with them reaching out to me in this way and that they should've contacted the authorities first before hunting me down on Facebook. I am guessing a neighbor got my license plate and told them that I was there taking photographs of their house.

Anyways, I did some digging and found out they are a police officer for a district near where I live. I told my friends about this and one of them told me that this is very illegal.

Is this correct? Also what should I do about this? To me, the way they reached out is very intimidating and unprofessional and really not okay.

Any info would help.

Thank you.

To preface this situation the homeowners received a letter in the mail mid October stating that someone will be on your property taking 2 photographs of the exterior of the house, they will knock or ring the doorbell first and if there is no answer then proceed to take the photographs. If the homeowner had any problems they would call.

Anyways, that leads us to today when I received a message through Facebook from a stranger asking ""Is there any reason you would be walking around taking pictures of homes?"". Immediately I was shocked and also concerned because I had no idea who this was and how they found my name. I told them I work for the city and gave them a number to call if they had any issues, also stating that I am uncomfortable with them reaching out to me in this way and that they should've contacted the authorities first before hunting me down on Facebook. I am guessing a neighbor got my license plate and told them that I was there taking photographs of their house.

Anyways, I did some digging and found out they are a police officer for a district near where I live. I told my friends about this and one of them told me that this is very illegal.

Is this correct? Also what should I do about this? To me, the way they reached out is very intimidating and unprofessional and really not okay.

Any info would help.

Thank you.

" Q: Employer changed offered salary my first day in the office...
T: GOOD
B: I recently started at a job with a large community mental health organization. In my offer letter they noted my start date and the hourly, biweekly, and annual salary.

Monday was my first official day on the job (I participated in online orientation the week prior) and I received a phone call from HR informing me that my salary would actually be 15-20% lower than what was written on the job offer I signed when I accepted the job.

There is a wee bit of complexity in that I work a school-year schedule but am on payroll as a FTE. So since I started after the beginning of the school year, I am supposed to receive a “pro-rated” salary, less than I would get if I started the first day of the school year. This was noted in the offer. They even created a table showing the days I would be working within the year. However, the math in their table resulted in the biweekly and annual salary that matched the offer listed at the top page of my job description.

Essentially, they messed up their math. I did not double check their math. For context, we’re talking a difference of under 10k here but, being a mental health worker that is a significant part of the income I was depending on.

Do I have any legal ground to stand on here? I quit a job I was working and ended an interview process with a different company to take this job. It seems like a breach of contract, right?

I appreciate any advice or help that can be offered. Thank you!

","Did I miss where you're located? Labor law can differ. If you're in the US, then you have some options but they're not great.

First,  you need to go to your boss, explain the error, and ask her/him to advocate on your behalf with HR. You relied on their promise, in writing, and if they're an ethical organization they should try to make it right.

Second, you have to decide how far you want to take this. I've heard of people trying to sue based on prommisorry estoppel. The idea is, they made you a promise, and you suffered because they broke their word. So it's probably worth talking to a lawyer if #1 doesn't help.

Finally, you have the nuclear option- posting reviews on glass door and social media. They can threaten to sue you for defamation or libel, so only take this route if your determined to make them pay and willing to bleed (metaphorically) in the process.

Honestly, your best bet would be to get a new job. It really sucks, sorry you're in this situation. END"
" Q: Neighbors complaining the pergola we just built is blocking their view
T: GOOD
B: We just finished building a 250 square foot pergola and suddenly the neighbors came by to complain it’s blocking their view. It’s one story and lower than the height of the rest of our house.

 It was built on our property of course. We didn’t get a permit, but pretty sure they’ve built a bunch of stuff without a permit too. They asked us to change the roof to something flatter, which is a) a negligible change (edit re:view)  and b) would cost us money to tear it down and rebuild it. Thoughts on how to handle it?

T: GOOD

My job was at a restaurant. The other day, my co-worker got a harsh chemical in their eye. Myself and another cook tried to help her wash her eye out with faucet water. (I have my current, active EMT and I'm about to return to school for more training. The owner knows I have my certification and experience.) We have no eye first aid items, however, so a sink was the best option. The other cook called the owner to come.

I return to my station but after 5 minutes, I ask again about the injured person. My boss sternly says, ""She's fine, go back to work."" Finally, I go out back to find my co-worker sitting in her car. She tells me her eye feels somewhat better but it still burns. It's also red and swollen. I explain to her that this is not a good sign and I really recommend going to the urgent care to receive proper treatment. She is unsure but it sounds like she is willing to go.

" Q: Fiberglass bed cover ruined thousands of dollars of stuff in my house
T: BAD
B: I'm in Utah.

I bought a mattress through a popular retailer here almost 2 years ago. Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, but that could just be that we moved here with no furniture and slept on the ground for a few months.

Our lease ends in January and I'm taking every step I can to get my security deposit back from our apartment complex. Thankfully its in pretty decent condition after 2 years, so I wasn't too worried until this morning.

Yesterday we took out all our clothes, bedding, couch cushion covers and started washing everything to pack away. The first thing we washed was our bed cover, and it turns out the inner layer surrounding the memory foam is a fiberglass blend (the inner layer does not have a zipper, and does not come off. We washed the outer layer). I don't think companies are required to disclose this or put it on tags, but in case it matters, neither of those things happened.

This morning I woke up suffocating. I panicked, ran to the kitchen to get some water, and hacked my lungs out for 10-15 minutes. My fiance woke up with a rash, and I had a small one too.

There's fiberglass EVERYWHERE.

I can't sit on the furniture in my house or wear any of the clothes we had in laundry piles without immediately getting itchy. We can't shower without drying off with paper towels, because our towels are also covered. We're going to try and wash one set of clothes a bunch of times as a control group to see if it'll help, but we're freaking out. We can't renew our lease here, and we can't afford to replace half our belongings before moving to a new place, let alone any cleaning costs for getting fiberglass out of an apartment.

I looked for a website and support number, but neither exist. I found the company that manufactures the mattresses, and the company that imports them for sale at retailers in Utah (separate companies) but everybody I talk to seems to think there's no fiberglass in mattress covers. I hadn't heard of it either, and I feel like a dick but I had a nasty argument with the fiance about it too, so I googled it and its not uncommon. She was right (she's making me write that, but she _was_ right)

[This is a patent description that I found](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2006014859A1/en)

My main question is where can I find somebody to light a fire under the company? I haven't gotten any responses, except for from their facebook page, which contained emojis so I don't think I'm being taken seriously.

" Q: Someone from the city came by requesting an easement
T: GOOD
B: A few months ago a construction company placed a water pipe in my yard.  They also knocked down several of my large trees in my tree line that starts about 30 feet from the center of the road which made my home a lot less private. I was not told that they would be removing my trees and they did not remove any of my neighbors trees where they were installing the pipe.  It appears that they negligently drove an excavator into my trees.  I couldn't find any evidence of an easement or any clear literature explaining right of way in my county, or get ahold of the specific contractor that did the damage so I just decided to let it go.

My neighborhood is zoned county, but is surrounded by city limits. A developer bought 17 acres across the street from me and is building a 64 unit cookie cutter neighborhood and the 17 acre lot was annexed by the city as part of the project approval.

Yesterday I received a call from a woman claiming to be with the city asking for an easement on my property for ""an electrical project"". She left me with the paper work and it mentions a 10' easement totaling 2600 sf for sewer, water and electrical.  And the compensation amount for the easement is only 1$.  It doesn't say specifically what they're going to do, but I think they're going to put in a sewer line in addition to the water line that was laid a few months ago and a gigantic transfer box to supply the new neighborhood across the street with power.  My home is supplied by power from an electric co op, and not the city.

Now given this paperwork mentions water in addition to sewer and electrical I'm thinking this proves they had no right to install the water pipe in my yard a few months ago and seems like they are looking for me to retroactively approve its install in addition to the other utility components they want to install in my yard.  It seems pretty unreasonable that I'm expected to bear the burden for all the utilities for this developers project for $1.

Is it typical to be offered 1$ for an easement?  Do I need to hire an attorney and if so what kind of attorney should I look for?

" Q: Potentially being accused of stealing rocks what should I do?
T: GOOD
B: Today I was going on a walk through my neighborhood and I noticed some vacant land. There were no houses, buildings, or fences on it at all. There were no “No Trespassing” signs and I was walking along a completely public road. While walking I noticed there were some rocks on this vacant land that I saw. I have recently been looking for some bigger rocks to use in a landscaping project in my garden. I thought that since nobody was around – there are no homes in that area – that is was just open land. So, after I got home, I drove my car back to pick up the rocks which were about 15 feet off the road. I had about 8 of them in my car and I was about to leave and then a man came up in his truck and accused me of stealing his rocks. He told me that was his land. I did not argue with him at all. I told him I did not realize that, and I put his rocks back exactly where I found them and while unloading his rocks from my trunk, he started taking pictures of my car, license plate, and me. He told me to leave so I left. I realize now that I never thought through what I was doing. Now I obviously realize that those rocks were on someone else’s property and I shouldn’t have taken them. This guy seemed pretty upset but I returned everything, and I did not disrupt his property. Any ideas on what will be done? Would he file a police report that could get me in trouble? I live in Michigan.

There were no “No Trespassing” signs and I was walking along a completely public road. While walking I noticed there were some rocks on this vacant land that I saw. I have recently been looking for some bigger rocks to use in a landscaping project in my garden. I thought that since nobody was around – there are no homes in that area – that is was just open land. So, after I got home, I drove my car back to pick up the rocks which were about 15 feet off the road. I had about 8 of them in my car and I was about to leave and then a man came up in his truck and accused me of stealing his rocks. He told me that was his land. I did not argue with him at all. I told him I did not realize that, and I put his rocks back exactly where I found them and while unloading his rocks from my trunk, he started taking pictures of my car, license plate, and me. He told me to leave so I left. I realize now that I never thought through what I was doing. Now I obviously realize that those rocks were on someone else’s property and I shouldn’t have taken them. This guy seemed pretty upset but I returned everything, and I did not disrupt his property. Any ideas on what will be done? Would he file a police report that could get me in trouble? I live in Michigan.

Edit: grammar and location

###

",Just to clarify - there is no unowned land with free rocks on it. You know the rocks have value because you know you would need to pay to buy them for your landscaping project. The actual risk is low because you returned the rocks. END
" Q: We got a email today from HR about individual pay rates
T: GOOD
B: Edit: I was wondering if there was a way to anonymously report this. I don’t want to be in trouble for something. I don’t plan on staying much longer after this and among a ton of other things, but I’m terrified of other potential employers finding out I reported this company. 

An email was sent to the front desk and support staff of my medical office employer in North Carolina today from HR. It’s... a little concerning. I spoke to my friend about it and he said it’s illegal what they’re trying to do. Below is a copy and paste of the email. 

“Sorry for sending this email to the entire front desk and support staff as it only applies to a few.  If you discuss your individual pay with anyone else in the company it is grounds for disciplinary action and potential termination.  There are several factors that go into each person's pay rate.  It is no one else's business and you should not share that information with anyone.  If we find out this is going on moving forward consider this your warning.”

Should I tell someone that were being threatened? Should I just find a new job and walk away?

","National Labor Relations Act contains a provision, Section 7 (29 U.S.C. § 157) https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157

Employees have the right to discuss the terms of their employment, including pay, with other employees. There are a few qualifications, like they can tell you not to discuss it on the clock when you should otherwise be working, but they can't outright prohibit it. It is illegal for them to do this. Fun that they put it in writing though.

","I think it has to do with a coworker of mine getting fed up with management. She had her yearly review yesterday, and they wouldn’t give her the raise she wanted. She disclosed that she knows that others doing the same job with far less education and experience are making more than her. When offered a slightly higher raise the next day, she still refused. Then we got this email later in the day.... and it’s scary. Because she isn’t wrong. 

We’ve noticed that it’s the female workers who seem to be paid less than the males doing the exact same work, with, like I said, far less education and experience. Or at least, getting more “complaints” against them from management rather than the male employees. END"

" Q: Can my apartment legally charge all tenants in the building a fee because an unidentified tenant is breaking a rule?
T: GOOD
B: So this is an apartment complex in Michigan. Once the shutdown started in March, the management stopped doing trash pick up for each building. Every tenant became responsible for hiking their own trash to the dumpster, and it has been that way ever since. Pretty much everyone in my building complies, but every now and then, there is a stray bag of trash waiting outside the front door or, worse, sitting in the hallway. No one knows who it is, and it's become more frequent in the last month. Numerous notices have been posted by management. The most recent notice reads ""the next time trash bags are outside the building or in the hallway, everyone in the building will be charged $25."" I've been here for years with no problems or complaints from other tenants. Is this tactic of group punishment/fines legal?

When I bought my house this past January, the house next door was being flipped to be sold. 
My house and the house next door are on a shared driveway. I didn't do the proper research before buying the house.

Finally, the house is for sale. 
Today, the real estate agent came by and talked to me, and gave me a letter. I will type out the letter for better context:

We have had a survey completed and researched tax records to determine there is no shared driveway agreement. So we just wanted to advise you so you can begin figuring out a different driveway/parking arrangement. Please feel free to ask me any questions and I am happy to help you in any way I can. Keep me posted on the progress. I know some buyers have expressed interest in fencing in property for dogs, so I wanted to let you know right away so you had time to figure it out.""

This woman can't just, MAKE us put a new driveway in, or force us to park on the street, where no parking is allowed? She also mentioned that the guys that are selling that house, had heard that we have access to a tractor (brother in law lives on the other side, and is friends with HIS neighbor who I think owns a tractor- we've never even spoken to them), so we don't have access to one, and she can't tell me to use it lol?) She wasn't brazen enough to tell me what exactly to do, just to do something. We don't have the money to do anything right now. I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. I'm really in a rut.

","What this woman is saying is that according to their research, you have no right to use the driveway and never did.  You were allowed to use the driveway by the previous owners, but the new owners do not intend to allow you to continue to do so.  Where you park or what you do is up to you, but if they are correct, you will not be able to use the driveway in the future.  

You need to do your own research now to see if their claims are valid.  Get your own survey.  Contact a real estate attorney to research the situation to see if you have an easement or if you have a claim for one.  It's possible they are not correct and that you DO have a right to use the driveway.  

But if their claims are correct, you will need to find somewhere else to park.  How you go about doing that is completely your call. END"

T: GOOD

It all started two weeks ago when I was hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend. He is a jerk, but he was being particularly mean that night and by the end he was kicking and hitting her. I was scared for both of us so I texted my sister and asked her to call the police. When the got there, they had stopped fighting, but I told the police what happened. They denied it and claimed that they were in a verbal argument and I was basically lying. The cops didn't really do anything. 

The next day her boyfriend came to my house and screamed at me and threatened me. My sister recorded what he said, which was basically admitting to the abuse (but not exactly). When I told him I was calling the police and that I now have proof he ran off and I assumed it was over.

Then he started texting me the next day on snapchat saying that if I did anything else he would have my dad deported. My dad is here on greencard (I was born here and my mom and sister are now citizens though). He has an older brother that works for ICE, so I think he might actually be able to do it. I am really scared but I havent told my parents because I dont want to scare them more. My dad is here legally, but he does do handyman work sometimes which isn't exactly legal (he takes cash payments) and could be a violation of labor laws. 

I want to help my friend, but like I don't want this to hurt my dad. We can't really afford lawyers, but I was wondering if I am right, is this extortion and can anything be done about it? And, how likely is it that there are legal grounds to deport my father?

","This is blackmail rather than extortion, but I think their threat to deport is baseless. They are just using a connection to intimidate you into silence. Screenshot any and all threats (yes, even though Snapchat tells them you took a screenshot, still do it).

T: GOOD
B: I work in accounting in a private company. Two weeks ago I was given documents to work on. I wasn't supposed to have access to these documents. Actually they were given to me by my manager because he wasn't doing his job. He was very late on something, which often happens, and asked me to take care of it instead. I did and started suspecting something was wrong as there were fishy discrepancies with invoices. I investigated a little on the side, which I now regret doing. It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer ""for safety reasons"", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.

Now I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything. And if I do this I'm scared I may be considered an accomplice because at first I hadn't noticed that some things they were doing were illegal and there's proof I authorized some payments.  I did what I was told and didn't suspect anything but I don't know how that could look like for an investigator. There's also the question of confidentiality if I talk to someone about company matters. The files that I accessed during my ""investigation"" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either. Could I be prosecuted or sued for this?

Then there's the matter of me being fired, it's putting me in a very difficult situation. I think it's retaliation but I don't know what to do with this. Can I file for unemployment?

I'm in this way over my head, any help will be greatly appreciated.

It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer ""for safety reasons"", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.

Now I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything. And if I do this I'm scared I may be considered an accomplice because at first I hadn't noticed that some things they were doing were illegal and there's proof I authorized some payments.  I did what I was told and didn't suspect anything but I don't know how that could look like for an investigator. There's also the question of confidentiality if I talk to someone about company matters. The files that I accessed during my ""investigation"" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either. Could I be prosecuted or sued for this?

Then there's the matter of me being fired, it's putting me in a very difficult situation. I think it's retaliation but I don't know what to do with this. Can I file for unemployment?

I'm in this way over my head, any help will be greatly appreciated.

T: GOOD
B: I am a nursing supervisor who has been called in for mandatory unpaid overtime constantly due to the COVID-19 surge here in Chicago. I worked 60 hours last week but will only be paid for 40.

I understand that as a salaried supervisor I would normally be exempt HOWEVER: 

1. I am not currently acting as a supervisor. I am acting as a regular staff nurse that they can force to work for free. 

2. I don’t know if you could really call this salary. I have a time card, I punch in and out, and if I even work 2 hours under 40, my paycheck is short. 

I’m told I need to be “on call” at all times, though I don’t get on call pay. Is this really legal?

" Q: Can my apartment complex actually evict us on baseless accusations of domestic violence?
T: GOOD
B: I am going to try to sum this up in as little of an explanation as possible. I have lived in this complex in Cincinnati, Ohio for five years now. Once in a one bedroom apartment, then my boyfriend moved in with me and we transferred to a two bedroom and we just moved into a townhome in May. 

We have had two noise complaints since the beginning of my time here. Both of which were in the two bedroom apartment. Only one was documented and given to us through e-mail. When we lived in the one bedroom we received one notice about or dogs droppings. They claimed we didn’t clean up after our dog out front, which is a lease violation. (This was not true. But we didn’t fight it and let it go) Another time they sent us a lease violation for leaving one bag of trash outside of our door on a rainy day. (We have a trash compactor that is a drive away, so taking it while it’s raining is a bit of a hassle. We didn’t fight this either) All of these incidences were prior to us transferring to the townhome that we live in now. We are in a completely different lease since May. In-between all of the years and the different “incidents” I have frequently butted heads with the property manager. Each time she has flagged us for something is always conveniently when I am trying to get them to do something that needs to be done. (Pressure washing, replacing air filters, etc.) 

Last week my boyfriend and I were putting up Christmas decorations at 10:30-12 at night. We received a strange e-mail at eleven at night that I didn’t see until midnight. The property manager emailed me, not even addressing me by name, and stated that they received a report about potential domestic violence from our unit. This, of course, is totally insane. In the email she said she had contacted our local police department to pull any reports that may have been made to them about our specific address, and she also said that they made a report. I called the police department and spoke to several different people, including the officer that was patrolling the area that night. I asked if they had any reports at all about our address, if they had been asked to pull reports about our address and if they had been told to dispatch to our location. (I know with domestic violence that police would be dispatched immediately) All of the people from the department were dumbfounded and confused because they hadn’t been contacted AT ALL. 

After I found this information I wrote the property manager back. I explained who I spoke to, what they told me, and of course denied domestic violence profusely. (Yes, I was a little rude). The next day I still hadn’t heard back from her. So, I called the office. I spoke to another female that works at the office that is a leasing agent. She said that she had already heard what happened and would have her get back to me. Still didn’t happen. 

Finally today she wrote me again and said “With the history of noise complaints and conferences from the last apartment this a reminder that quiet hours are from 7pm to 11am. If we receive another complaint or police report they will have to give us a 30 days notice to vacate.” 

Again, we have had no noise complaints for this new unit and new lease. We also have had no conferences so I have no idea what this is all about? And we certainly have had no police reports filed. Is she just blowing smoke to scare us? Did she not handle something properly and she’s trying to cover her tracks? Can she legitimately evict us off of NOTHING?

","It might be an ongoing issue for your neighbors if you don’t really follow the hours. Sometimes the leasing office won’t send a warning every time they receive a complaint. I’ve complained about my neighbors marijuana use over 10 times and I think they’ve only been warned 3 times. 

I’d definitely try to stay within quiet hours if you haven’t already. The domestic abuse could have been a previous address, accidental email instead of noise complaint, or your landlord is making false claims. 

If it is a leasing company, there is always someone above her you can address concerns to if she is in fact claiming false information to evict you. END"
" Q: Neighbour kid (teenager) is being abused. Asked to crash on my couch tonight and I said yes. Can I get in legal trouble for this?
T: GOOD
B: I am going to keep this as simple as possible. I am in Nova Scotia. 

I moved to this neighborhood 2 years ago. I have observed my neighbour slapping and verbally abusing his kids a few times outside in the yard. Not like beating the shit out of them, but...like, still hitting them when he is mad. I once called the police non-emergency line about it and they sent someone but I don't know what happened with it afterwards. 

I have only met the parents and one of three kids. Last night the kid I met (15 or 16 years old) knocked on my door near midnight and he looked rough and asked if he could crash here for the night. I said okay and he slept on my couch but seems reluctant to go home and asked if he can stay again. I didn't call his parents. 

He left today but asked if he could come back if he had to later. I said to check in with me later. I have a feeling like this is illegal and I have some lawful duty to tell his parents? I am Googling frantically but can't understand anything.

Did I do something illegal? Would letting him come back be illegal? What kind of person could I contact for advice? I want to help him but I worry that my help is only going to cause legal problems.

###

","I would call a CPS line for advice. They would know more.

The problem lies with the kid, there are so many things that could go wrong depending on he says or tells his parents. If he is running away and his parents try to find him there could very quickly be an entire shitstorn you don't want to be a part of. 

As far as legality its probably not illegal. But becoming involved with something you shouldn't be in the middle of isn't smart.

###

","Every situation I have ever read here regarding impounded cars always comes down to this:

No matter what - pay the bill and retrieve the car immediatly.

If you are wrong about if the car is legally in the lot then the time you are waisting to figure it out pushes the bill higher. If you are correct it is gonna take time to get it figured out - probably more time then you want to be without a car.  AND you have a duty to limit that bill anyhow.  

Today - beg or borrow (stealing is probably not a good idea) the money and retrieve the car.  Then look into the justification and whether you have some sort of case to be paid back by someone. END"

B: I live in a lease-per-bed apartment in Florida. There are 4 roommates in total and 1 of the women has been repeatedly trying to get the 3 of us kicked out since the day we moved in. She has lived here for a year longer than us and has repeatedly complained about our behavior to the leasing office and tried to get us removed from the apartment although we haven’t done anything to violate the lease- we just have different schedules and it annoys her that we are usually all up pretty late because we work until around midnight whereas she works early in the morning.

###

","&gt; Is this breaking any laws in the state of Florida?  

Is this video-only or audio and video? Florida is a two-party consent state for audio recordings. An in-home security camera in a common area with video only does not require your consent. 

&gt; I know there needs to be written consent to record people in areas that privacy is expected in FL 

Two-party consent has an exception if there is no expectation of privacy. However, that applies to having a conversation out in public. Within your own home, an expectation of privacy is generally presumed to exist. 

&gt; I don’t want to go to the leasing office to make a complaint 

That's less of a legal issue and more of a roommate issue. It sounds like you and the other two roommates should be working together on this and decide as a group if you all wish to file a joint complaint. END"

" Q: Is Paying for Extra Credit in Highschool Legal?
T: GOOD
B: Recently my school setup a charity event that will grant students extra credit in classes if they donated $5. Is this legal? It sounds so illegal to me since it creates an unnecessary paywall for increasing grades. 

The school is located in NYC. The charity event has no education value to it. It’s merely game time on a Zoom meeting. I feel that this event is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL. What’s so ironic about this event is that it disadvantages poor kids when it’s supposed to help a charity that helps poor people!

Unfair pay walls for extra credit on tests are not rare at this school. It seems to be ignored by the school since it’s been happening for a while. The events aren’t even created by the school administrators; it’s created by the teachers. 
 I would love to here peoples opinion on this!

Have your parents talk to the principal, administrators or the school board. I agree with your ethnical assessment of the situation, if it is as you have presented it. I would take it up with the principal or administrators  and the school board if necessary. Additionally, it unfairly disadvantages students who do not donate in terms of college applications (or unfairly advantages those who do donate). END"
" Q: Is Paying for Extra Credit in Highschool Legal?
T: BAD
B: Recently my school setup a charity event that will grant students extra credit in classes if they donated $5. Is this legal? It sounds so illegal to me since it creates an unnecessary paywall for increasing grades. 

The school is located in NYC. The charity event has no education value to it. It’s merely game time on a Zoom meeting. I feel that this event is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL. What’s so ironic about this event is that it disadvantages poor kids when it’s supposed to help a charity that helps poor people!

Unfair pay walls for extra credit on tests are not rare at this school. It seems to be ignored by the school since it’s been happening for a while. The events aren’t even created by the school administrators; it’s created by the teachers. 
 I would love to here peoples opinion on this!

###

","Well, remember they give out (used to?) credit (usually 10%) just for showing up. I remember one class that 10% was given for participation in a charity event organised by the class.

What are the rules with those who can't afford it? Has anyone asked? Normally, it's waived in situations like this but teachers and admin don't know if you can't. END"

","If the principal is aware of this and it continues, your next step is the district Superintendent.  Failing that, your school board will have (usually monthly) meetings where the public can address the board.

There is no way the district wants students getting credit for donating to charity, or anything else involving money for that matter.

High schools throughout the country are accredited, meaning an agency (usually the state dep't of education) certifies that a diploma given by a high school means something.  It makes sense.  

For example, you have to have a diploma to enlist in the military.  The state is certifying that this HS graduate has met the minimum academic requirements to have the diploma.

If the Department of Education in your state learned students could pay to improve their grade, they would lose their collective minds.

Grades are important.  Admission to certain colleges/universities might require a certain GPA.  If a student could buy a box of charity candy-bars or donate cash to get that A so they can get into a military academy, for example, it would keep a more deserving person out.

So if the district doesn't put an immediate halt to it, have your parents send a letter to the state department of education, and they will. END"

","As for Covid guidelines contact the county health department. Unfortunately, you're absolutely correct there is no way possible to make this covid-safe - in fact - this is extremely likely to spread it from one to everyone.

The only possible around this is to buy your own breathalyzer - and your employer say ok - or the health department telling your employer they are a health hazard. END"

","Yes, I'm bringing my prescriptions for my two inhalers and whatever medical records I can find.   The manager/owner guy said, ""It's okay Sexybroth, I know you don't drink at work"" when he was showing me how the BACTRAC works.   I couldn't generate enough air for long enough to make it work, and the error code was FLOW.

Despite this, the next day his friend (the girl who was out with COVID) called me and my coworker into the office to do the breathalyzer.    Some customers came in so I had to go up front to the cash register.   It stayed busy until it was time for her to leave.

" Q: Hey y’all. So I used to work for a ranch and my boss wants to sue me
T: GOOD
B: As the title says, I worked for a ranch and my boss wants to sue me for supposed damages. He is claiming that in a matter of just 6 days there were more than $10k in damages, including deaths of animals and what not. Well the thing is, we raised goats, and they only go for about $300-$400 a head, and only about 9 died. If my math is correct, That’s not $10k. The other thing is, we were on that specific job for nearly two weeks, not six days as he’s claiming. And one more thing, he won’t pay us. He owes me damn near $800 and he also owes a co worker nearly $500. That don’t sound like much, but when you’re stuck eating a can of beans for all three meals of the day, it’s a lot. Me and my buddy have since quit, but it’s been almost two weeks since we were supposed to be payed. He also was supposed to have us fill out tax forms and whatnot the day or day after we were hired, but he refused to have us fill them out until the day we quit. Basically I just need some help here. I think he’s just trying to scare us by saying he’ll have his lawyers contact us about the “damages” so that he doesn’t have to pay us. I mean maybe it’s because I’m just a young adult still and he thinks I’m stupid, but I think I have enough to win a legal battle if there is one. Thanks y’all

","[Put in a wage claim regarding your unpaid wages](https://laborcommission.utah.gov/divisions/utah-antidiscrimination-and-labor-uald/wage-claim/).

If - and I'm making no judgments here - you have inflicted damages on your employer through malice or gross negligence, they still have to pay you first. They can't withhold your wages and call it good.

Furthermore, holding an employee liable for losses incurred during normal business is fairly hard. It's not enough to prove that the goads died, or even that they died because of something you did. They'd have to prove you either deliberately killed the goats, or that you did something you should reasonably have known would lead to their deaths, with no reasonable excuse for doing so - abandoning them with the gate open, or something of that nature, might do it.

Also highly irregular to have your tax forms filled out after quitting. Your going to want to make sure that he withholds the correct amount for taxes and reports your wage correctly. END"

" Q: [PA] Customer got assaulted by a passer-by while dining outdoors at my family's bar. He wants us to pay his medical bills.
T: GOOD
B: My family owns a small bar in Philadelphia. When the city started allowing outdoor dining again, we set up tables on the sidewalk (with a permit) since we never had a designated area for that.

Back in September, a customer eating at one of the tables got into an altercation with a homeless guy who was passing by, and ended up needing to go to the ER. My mom was the one running the place that day and offered to call him an ambulance, but he declined. The homeless guy booked it, and by the time the cops got there (an hour or so later...) he was long gone. 

Earlier today, we got a letter sent to the bar with a copy of the medical bills from this guy's ER visit, and he wants us to pay them. To be clear, the letter is from him personally, not a lawyer, but there were vague threats of legal action. My parents were debating going to talk to a lawyer who represented them in a lawsuit once before, but they decided to hold off unless/until things escalate. Money's tight right now, as it is for pretty much everybody.

I do understand that it sucks to get punched in the face while you're eating lunch, but I don't see how we have any responsibility to control Philly's homeless population. Do we have any liability here?

","Get an estate lawyer ASAP, both to dig into this, and to see if there are any other shenanigans. The fact he may not have brought this up in probate may be an issue, but it may also fall within WI's statute of limitations on claims in probate, which is 6 years.  If your mother died in Minnesota, then the statute of limitations is 3 years, which means it's probably too late (but you still want a lawyer to be 100% sure).

You should pull a copy of the deed for the property and get your name added as a result of your inheritance *if* the property is indeed yours.

T: GOOD
B: So my friend left her car legally parked in front of her partner's apartment on Saturday at 5. At some point between then and the next day around 9am the car was taken by the police. My friend woke up needing to take her partner to the airport and had to scramble and call me to get them there. We called the local tow company that the city uses to tow people illegally parked and they said they didn't have it. When she called the police to report it stolen she was notified that they had it and it actually was at the aforementioned tow lot. They said it was taken as evidence in a hit and run investigation.  She called that company back and they said, yes, they did have it. It was registered differently in their system because it was a special circumstance. The tow company also noted that the police had access to her contact info the whole time but neglected to contact her.

For the last two days my friend has been totally unable to get any additional details from the police. We don't know if her car was stolen and used in a hit and run or if it was just sideswiped while parked. She was told to contact a specific police precinct yesterday. They didn't return any of her calls. When she called today she was told that the officer in charge of the case would contact her today which hasn't happened. Currently all she has is a case number and the officer's name and badge number. This is her only form of transportation and she has no idea why exactly it was taken. It seems like cars are side swiped all the time without the police confiscating them. She also has no idea when or if she should expect to get her car back or what state it's in. Does anyone know if she has any legal recourse here? This is happening in Richmond, Virginia.

" Q: [Maryland] Neighbor refused access to remove dying tree on property line
T: GOOD
B: I have a tree on my property line that is dying and needs to be removed before it falls on its own. I've had multiple arborists come out and tell me that it needs to be removed. It does not appear to be in imminent danger of falling, but it is clearly in decline. 

I spoke to the neighbor about removing the tree and while they seemed enthusiastic about having it gone, they made it quite clear that my contractors were not allowed on their land to do the job. I've since taken another look at the tree and I'm not convinced that the trunk is wholly on my property. I believe it has grown several inches onto the neighbor's land.

I know that generally when a tree or branch falls, cleanup is the responsibility of the person who owns the property where it fell. The exception to that is if that owner can show negligence by the person whose land the tree was on before it fell. How does that change if the tree's trunk is located on both properties? Who would be liable if the tree fell and damaged a vehicle parked on a nearby public street? What if it fell and damaged my house? What if it fell and damaged my neighbor's house? Does the percent of the trunk on either side of the property line have an impact on who is liable?

My primary concern here is protecting my own liabilities when the tree does decide that it's tired of standing up. A secondary goal is to be able to inform the neighbor of their own liability when the tree falls, in hopes that they will change their mind and allow my contractors to just get rid of the thing before anyone is liable for damage caused by it falling down.

","That tree isn't yours, it belongs to both property owners. In Maryland, ownership of a tree is determined by the location of the trunk. The trunk is located on the boundary line and trees located on a boundary line are considered joint property. No single neighbor can decide to remove the tree. You can, however, trim the tree back to the property line, provided that doing so does not injure the tree.

Neither you, nor your neighbor have any liability to each other for damages from the tree In [*Melnick v. C.S.X. Corp., et al*., 312 Md. 511, 540 A.2d 1133 (1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12736980357702327541), the Maryland Court of Appeals held that a landowner does not have a cause of action against an adjoining landowner when trees, vines, roots, and other plants or plant debris from the adjoiner’s property encroach upon and cause damage to the landowner’s property.

" Q: Being stalked and harassed by my ex boyfriend since April 2020
T: GOOD
B: Hello redditors,

Coming to you guys since the police seem unable to do anything despite textbook stalking, cyberstalking and harassment by my ex boyfriend who I broke up with April 2020.

List of things he has done:

1. Attempted to break into my apartment twice while I was not home, left a spare key he must have copied from me in the doorknob

2. Showed up at my apartment randomly numerous times

3. Was caught by security officers at my school campus attempting to break into my car, was seen laying under my car with a black box in hand, which he ran off with when the security officer saw him

4. Drove by my current boyfriend’s house at the exact time I pulled up

5. Showed up at a remote nature spot I was at in full face covering

6. Due to the above events I looked for a tracking device on my car and FOUND ONE. The police currently have the tracking device

7. Hacked approximately 15 of my accounts, attempted deletion, successfully deleted or changed passwords of a couple

8. Cancelled my plane tickets for a future trip
 
9. Disabled my car at least twice

10. Has called approximately 50 times from a blocked number 

He owns legal and illegal guns. He is an alcoholic and drug user. His father is a known criminal and murderer. I am scared for my life of him yet the police can’t do anything about it since there are no overt threats or explicit proof that it was all him. I have tried to get an injunction for stalking but was directed by my lawyer that I may be in more danger if I attempt it, or attempt it and don’t get it, since historically that is when the most domestic violence occurs. I was also told that stalking cases are notoriously hard to prove. I don’t understand why the police themselves cannot charge him, especially with the tracking device in their possession. 

Please direct me in the right direction as this has continued for months and has no indication of stopping, as the most recent event was last night. 

Thanks in advance.

[Florida]

","Fire your attorney.

Find a new attorney, get in contact with the various domestic violence groups in your area.  Tell them everything you have listed here.  Just one of those bullet points is enough for a TRO.  

Fire your attorney.  Did I say that one yet?

Go to the police, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.  Report every iota of evidence you have, meet with detectives who specialize in this area.  Do not allow yourself to be put on hold or dismissed -- explain that you are in fear for your life and are the victim of a crime.  Get your new attorney to ensure all information is sent along to the prosecutor's office and see if they can get this fast-tracked.  Stuff like House of Ruth can provide useful resources.  If you move quickly, a TRO can be issued within the day and he will be served with the order and then ordered to attend court.  This is critical: IF he does in fact have the illegal guns with him, and if he is as unstable as he appears, this may end with his arrest.  Be ready for that outcome.

So to recap:

Fire your attorney.  Go to the police.  Seek resources for assistance.  FIRE YOUR ATTORNEY.

You are the victim of an ongoing criminal violation by your ex-boyfriend, and I cannot stress this enough _you must express the fear for your life to the appropriate entities_. END"

","&gt; He was on the lease

He ***is*** on the lease. He owes rent. Signing a new lease doesn't absolve him of the current one. You have to try to do whatever you can to pay the full rent (can you get a roommate?) and then sue him when your lease expires. You'll win.

As for the dogs, for better or worse they are considered property like anything else (for example a television) so you could sue for their value. If you sue for that perhaps he'll give back one to avoid a judgment. Where are you located? Small claims court is likely your best resource here. Sorry you're going through this. END"

" Q: URGEN Attorney Needing Advice on a Custody Battle with an International Flight Risk (Time Pertinent Due to Monday Flight Risk)
T: GOOD
B: I am an attorney in San Diego. I just got a new client. Her ex-husband has 1.5 year old son, and she has found that he is fleeing the country to Turkey on Monday/Tuesday. I am unsure of the time of flight, but know that Father will be in Istanbul on Wednesday 5 PM, Istanbul time. The earliest we can get in for an Ex Parte, is Tuesday afternoon which will be too late. 

Concerns - My understanding is that once a child gets to Turkey, Mother will not have any rights. There is no Hague convention, and Turkey will not respect Mother's plea for custody/visitation. In addition, I feel Turkey is extremely dangerous for Americans, especially for a 1.5 year old child.

For this matter, California has proper jurisdiction. I plan on going Ex Parte, asking for immediate return of child and passport but cannot get in until Tuesday. I fear this will be too late. I have considered filing a TRO (though no abuse has occurred) on Monday morning to try to get more immediate assistance from the court. 

As a note, Father is in Oklahoma with child. It is believed he is either flying out of Oklahoma or Dallas. 

I have contacted local police, child abduction units, and TSA/airport police, but they have all indicated that this cannot 100% ensure they don't board that flight. 

To provide some more information, Father got an Airbnb in Turkey for one month. But what stands out is that Father is not Turkish. Concerns are Father will try to flea to another country with the child. 

I want to know if there is another viable strategy that can be implemented in such a short time.  Thank you for any and all help.

I used to practice family law in CA. OP does not know the California Family Law Code well enough to be handling this extremely time sensitive issue, and is reaching out anonymously on Reddit instead of finding a competent attorney or researching/reading the statutes appropriately, thereby preventing their client from finding someone who knows how to actually protect this mother's rights before she loses her child forever (presuming that part is accurate).

The attorney who needs to handle this immediately is one who knows how to get an emergency protective order under Family Code section 6240 et seq (as well as any other possibly fruitful avenues based on the circumstances) AND how to enforce it under the UCCJEA. It is clear from this post that OP knows neither and does not have the time or resources to learn it. The best OP can do is recognize he/she is not competent to provide the counsel needed and help the client find someone who can. END"
" Q: URGEN Attorney Needing Advice on a Custody Battle with an International Flight Risk (Time Pertinent Due to Monday Flight Risk)
T: GOOD
B: I am an attorney in San Diego. I just got a new client. Her ex-husband has 1.5 year old son, and she has found that he is fleeing the country to Turkey on Monday/Tuesday. I am unsure of the time of flight, but know that Father will be in Istanbul on Wednesday 5 PM, Istanbul time. The earliest we can get in for an Ex Parte, is Tuesday afternoon which will be too late. 

Concerns - My understanding is that once a child gets to Turkey, Mother will not have any rights. There is no Hague convention, and Turkey will not respect Mother's plea for custody/visitation. In addition, I feel Turkey is extremely dangerous for Americans, especially for a 1.5 year old child.

For this matter, California has proper jurisdiction. I plan on going Ex Parte, asking for immediate return of child and passport but cannot get in until Tuesday. I fear this will be too late. I have considered filing a TRO (though no abuse has occurred) on Monday morning to try to get more immediate assistance from the court. 

As a note, Father is in Oklahoma with child. It is believed he is either flying out of Oklahoma or Dallas. 

I have contacted local police, child abduction units, and TSA/airport police, but they have all indicated that this cannot 100% ensure they don't board that flight. 

To provide some more information, Father got an Airbnb in Turkey for one month. But what stands out is that Father is not Turkish. Concerns are Father will try to flea to another country with the child. 

I want to know if there is another viable strategy that can be implemented in such a short time.  Thank you for any and all help.

","Aside from the TSA/Airport Police routes if you can figure out what airline the child will be departing the US from (Turkish or American would be most logical for non-stops from Dallas, but obviously less direct routings are possible) I (though NAL) would contact the airline -- either through their legal department or failing that, calling reservations and getting a supervisor on the phone, to make it clear to them that the child does not have permission from both parents to leave the country. Airlines hate being fined by international authorities for immigration issues and this is on the high end (e.g. at one point United was loosing something like $10k a month in fines from Germany because people hadn't signed their passports). The airline can flag the reservation to prevent check-in and boarding until the passenger talks to a human, human can see note in PNR and contact police, etc. 

Likewise if you are able contact the port director for CBP at the likely international gateway. CBP usually is only/mostly concerned with arriving passengers but they can intervene in departures. 

Of course I'm sure you're already aware of these resources but just in case:

" Q: My mom pocketed insurance money on a car that's under my name. Bank is threatening repossession.
T: GOOD
B: I originally posted this is r/personalfinance and was told to post here.

So I bought a car for my mom 2 years ago using a loan with my bank. The vehicle is registered under my name only. I am on her insurance policy. She is the primary holder. She got into an accident recently and took the car to the mechanic for repairs. She received the insurance claim check and chose to spend the money on something else instead of getting the car out. I get a call a month later from the bank telling me about the situation (I was unaware of what was going on and assumed everything was being handled). They tell me that the mechanic is processing a lien and its going to get repossessed if I dont work it out with the mechanic. The mechanic is asking for a total of 5,400 which includes 1,950 in storage fees for 30 days. I only have about a fifth of that. Shes only willing to take the 3 grand then the rest in payments and she wants a decision by the 21st. I do not have 3 grand. I tried to apply for many loans and have been denied. Im wondering what my options are at this point. Do I let the bank repossess it? Is the car worth getting out? I still owe 17,000 on the vehicle and I have over 6,000 in credit card debt that I've accumulated this year due to the first covid lockdown. I've heard of surrendering a vehicle but not sure how that would work and I would think I'd still have to pay the mechanic to do that.

I tried to keep this as short and straight to point as possible. If there's any questions I will gladly answer them. Any help is very much appreciated. I am 27 and made the wrong decision by trusting my mom and I dont want to make another bad decision. Thanks ahead of time.


Some people were confused in the other sub so here are some more details:

*My mom has a gambling addiction and it has become worse. She's homeless now and spends all her time at the casino. I realize now that I'm an idiot for buying her a car when I was aware of her gambling habit, but at the time I was convinced that everything would be fine. She has been making payments on time but even if she couldn't make the payments, I would take care of it because I could afford it. That was my thought process at the time when I bought the car but it never occurred to me that she could pocket insurance money if an accident happened. She had me thinking everything was fine and she was gonna get the car from the mechanic but I had to find out the truth a month later from the bank. 

*I dont know why I wasnt contacted by the mechanic or insurance. I dont know why it took a month for the bank to call.

*I spoke to the insurance company to ask why the check wasn't issued out to me or the mechanic and I was told that legally, since my moms the primary holder, she can request the check be sent to her under her name even though its only my name on the registration.

*The mechanic filed the lien about a week ago

*The car is worth 12 - 13k right now

T: GOOD
B: I can go into more detail but I'm going to attempt to keep this as short as possible.  
United States/Iowa 

FIRST ISSUE: Challenge

I joined a gym challenge where all the new members compete for $1,000. Fours days prior to the last day and weigh in's the gym closed due to ""covid"". This gym didn't pick a winner or pay out the prize that was advertised. From my research this gym was the only one out of dozens that didn't finish the challenge. No refunds were given and on top of that they wouldn't allow me to compete in the next challenge because ""Ive already competed"". Is there anything I can do, this gym doesn't care about my complaint and dismisses every attempt to get this figured out. The gym pushes me to talk to corporate but then corporate pushes me back on the location.

SECOND ISSUE: Gym services

This gym sold me on a yearly paid in full membership. I was sold on all the things that were included. Fast forward 3 months later and the gym has new owners but is still the same gym. These new owners are starting to charge for services that were free to me before and was part of the entire package. They won't budge on the fact that these were free for me upon signup and advertised as such and dismisses my complaints.

I'm really looking for some advice here, am I just out of all my money here? What are my options if I even have any? Thank you for reading and happy holidays!

B: California. 

My work had me sign a document stating I can not drive during work hours. They said if I don't sign it they won't hire me. I do have a poor driving record so I didn't really care as it was understandable. After looking further at the contract it states I can't drive period. On or off the clock i tested my theory and sure enough they gave me a write up when I drove myself to lunch one day off the clock. My question is, is that legal for them to do if it isn't, what can I do.

EDI this is straight from the document 

""I hereby promise to refrain at all times from operating any motor vehicle, regardless of ownership, in the course of scope of my employment with [COMPANY] for any reason whatsoever, either during or after work hours, either on or off premise.""

###

","Sounds like your HR person doesn’t understand what that contract means and needs to talk to the company’s lawyer. 
“In the course and scope of employment”
That means while doing your job—- not during working hours. So, you are prohibited from driving for (on behalf of) your job. You are not prohibited from driving during lunch. That would be outrageous. Find out who the company has in house, or who they retain and ask your manager to get this clarified. Your leverage is that if they control you during lunch then maybe you should be getting paid for that time. (That’s a terrible argument, but it’s scary enough that it may make them have an actual lawyer look at the contract)

T: GOOD
B: So my neighbor who is a schizophrenic and has multiple charges against him, one being assault of a police officer (kicked cop in the nuts and cop required surgery) and only got probation, has been breaking into the main box for the internet company and cutting the wires. The box is contained inside a cover that is about 3 ft high. The box just happens to be in the alley just behind his house.

So this started last Friday. We lost internet and were scheduled to have it fixed on Tuesday of this week, but the tech told us that he was working on another homeowners internet and traced the problem back to this box. This box controls ~60 different homeowners DSL internet and they all lost service. We weren't aware of the tech fixing it and just thought they had fixed it another way. Then Monday night the internet went down  again and thankfully I didn't cancel the order for the tech.

Tech comes out Tuesday and tells us the story of fixing it Sat and that it was cut. He tells us that this time it had a lock and the lock was broken off and wires were cut again. He called the county police, we live in a small town of 75 people, and they came down, talked to a few people and left. The tech told us that it has cost approximately $2000 to fix it both times and asked us to try to see who was doing it. At this point I was pretty sure it was the neighbor, but the tech said there was a disgruntled employee and he thought maybe it was him.

Fast forward to last night. I hear some noise and go outside to see him fucking with the box. I go inside and the internet is now off, so I call the county police and they tell me the internet company has to call about it. I text the tech and tell him and call into company who schedules a fix and takes notes. 

This morning tech shows up and calls cops. Cops say there is really nothing they can do, but they will set up cameras. Tech was pissed about it and decided to set up dummy wires and bury the real ones, so that he'd have to dig it up. The tech says it looked like he took an axe to the box. The tech is sketched out because the guy was circling the block watching him on Tuesday and today the guy is in his shed just watching them. 

Neighbor is a nut. Thinks that he can make forcefields on his vehicle and he can sharpen blades with the light from a flash light. I hate that he lives by us and hope that he goes to prison. He has 6 restraining orders, meth charges, and numerous other charges. He has an SES in regards to the assault and meth charge.

Trust me repeat calls get a priority as it makes more work for technicians and for their dispatch. I would also mention you saw someone cut it any time it needs to be fixed and you observed the person cutting it. They will put that in the notes and for the company I worked for it only took an average of 2 fixes of witnessed purposeful tampering before police involvement was made.

" Q: My wife, a teacher in Texas, is being intimidated by school administration into changing student grades.
T: GOOD
B: On Monday of this week it became apparent to administration that an overwhelming number of students would be receiving a failing grade for the first half of the year in my wife's class.  In spite of her doing everything she could to engage with students, their parents, their coaches, and her fellow teachers, she simply could not get a large portion of her online only students to actually attend the zoom classes or turn in any work.  She pretty much removed all deadlines for assignments where she could and even informed the students that as long as they took the midterm exam and passed it then she would give them a passing grade.  However, it has simply been radio silence from the students and many of their parents.

That said, on Monday she was pulled into a meeting with her administration and told that if she did not ""find a way"" to give these failing students passing grades that she would be reprimanded and forced to sign a ""growth contract"" effectively putting her on a type of probation.  Since that meeting she has been inundated with in-person meetings with and phone calls from the administrative staff saying that they are going to ""help"" by grading some of the midterm exams for her, inspite of her insistence that she be allowed to grade them herself.

Now that brings us to today, when another administrator that she has never worked with before suddenly called her while she was in the middle of a zoom class with students.  He began berating her at a high volume about how it was completely unacceptable that he was being forced to do her work for her and how he was going to ensure that she be punished for ""not doing her job"".  She was obviously very upset and started having a panic attack while still on camera with her students.  She couldn't get herself under control and so she informed the school that she needed to leave immediately for health reasons.  She came home about an hour ago sobbing and it took me a while to get her to calm down.

She let me know that she has been secretly recording her interactions with the administration, when she could, for a while now (Texas is one party consent).  Apparently, the administration staff have been getting increasingly hostile with the teaching staff in general for a couple of months now.  They have been conducting more and more in-person interactions, presumably, so that they would never have to put anything they said in writing.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am not sure if this is relevant, but she did file a complaint about 2 months ago with HR when she discovered that the administration had deliberately lied to her about two separate contacts that she had with covid positive staff.  The official guidance released by the school district stated that anyone in close contact with a covid infected person would mandated a 2 week quarantine.  The administration had told her that the first contacted person was sick with some other than covid and the second person informed her himself that he had had covid upon his return to work.  The school administration had said he was only taking some time off for family matters.  I can understand medical privacy being a concern, but he second person was someone that she works with in her classroom on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, don't know if this is going to get any useful responses.  But, I am worried that they are doing everything in their power to set her up for some kind of ""justified"" dismissal and unfortunately her panic attack causing her to leave today may have given them all the ammo they need to do it.  Should we seek professional legal advice?  If so what kind of lawyer would be best to consult?

","OP, is your wife part of a teachers union? They can absolutely help with this as far as the intimidation.

As far as grades. School systems are doing a lot of this to make sure kids don't fail. It is absolutely disturbing and the fact that I have seen many parents tell their kids they DO NOT have to go to online classes because of these internal policies not to fail kids is scary.

Administration can ultimately override her grades if they wish. Your wife would need to look into her contract as far as the ""improvement plan"". Ultimately contracts most likely dont take into consideration the current circumstances and most likely does have language that discussss a large amount of class failures as something that would reflect badly on her.

Moving forward she may want to look into if she can involve truency for students not completing assignments. Many districts are still following truency guidelines in some fashion to hold parents accountable. If she can show these students have been referred for absenteeism than that will help her case. END"
" Q: Non-owner putting up No Trespassing sign on land in his name.
T: GOOD
B: My grandparents have a large amount of land, about 4 acres I think. They don't really use it, so they've let a neighbor farm on it for years, free of charge.

Earlier today, my mom and I went over to help with an unrelated issue and saw that a No Trespassing sign had been put up on my grandparents land. Upon inspection, it had the neighbors name signed onto it. We learned that this neighbor had apparently designated himself as my grandparents ""representative"" to the city (verbally, nothing was in writing), and was upset about some new drainage system that the city wanted to put in to help reduce standing water after rain and stuff. This neighbor apparently thinks that this will cause MORE problems, no idea what his reasoning is, and has reportedly become an annoyance to the city with his opposition to the project, so we're guessing he put the sign up as another way to try and stop the project.

My grandparents had no idea that this sign was put up, and they don't want it there either, especially in this neighbors name. They should be able to just take it down, since its on their property, right? Are there any other options or risks, or anything at all that can or should be done? We live not far from Green Bay, WI.

###

","NAL

"" so they've let a neighbor farm on it for years "" ... how many years? Do they have documented communication regarding this agreement? Do they have any evidence of it? Just want to make sure you aren't looking at possible adverse possession claims at some point. 

Have grandparents spoken with neighbor about it and expressed their concerns? That would be the best place to start, hopefully keeping it amicable but setting expectations of what neighbor is/isn't allowed to do on their land. Again, in case there are problems down the road, should attempt to have some kind of documentation/paper trail of those conversations. 

Grandparents should also probably communicate with the city regarding the matter, if neighbor is raising a fuss about property that belongs to grandparents. 

Pretty sure they should be able to remove signs added to their property by a non-owner, as long as that neighbor hasn't established adverse possession of the property. Again, it's in everyone's best interests to try to keep it amicable at this point, as property disputes can get messy and expensive very quickly. END"

","The neighbor and your grandparents should **talk** about this. 

1. The neighbor does not have any right to misrepresent his interests to the city, and your grandparents can take steps to correct that, but 
2. The law gives some protections to the person in possession of land, even if he does not own it. Posting a No Trespassing sign may not be objectionable for that reason, but if your grandparents object to it, their position prevails. 
3. Your description suggest that the neighbor's use is by permission, and that means adverse possession is a no-go unless he tries to mischaracterize the arrangement. 

They should consult a real estate lawyer. The cost should not be too high, to discuss their options. END"

B: I feel that it's unfair for me to pay the fine as it's their fault that I didn't receive the ticket (I checked the car rental invoice, and my name is correctly spelled there). I'm also worried that if I don't pay, sometime in the future I'll visit Italy again and will be coerced to pay them or worse.

What would you do in my situation?

###

","IANAL but I know italian law pretty well.

First of all, were you pulled over by Law Enforcement? In that case, what they gave you (even if you refused to take it) is a valid ticket.

If you weren't pulled over, they had 1 year to notify the ticket to you and/or to the owner of the vehicle (Codice della Strada, Art. 1: ""the notification shall be done within 360 days starting when the violation is ascertained"").

Therefore, if the ticket wasn't notified within a year it's null and void. You can cite the law above to the collection agency and explain them you don't have to pay a single dime and they cannot bother you any more.

Italy hasn't a way to enforce you to pay that fine. Let me rephrase: there's a way but it's a legal and administrative nightmare, therefore they won't do anything. An example is Diego Armando Maradona: he owed several milion dollars for unpaid taxes but Italian IRS couldn't do anything outside Italy. In his case and he being really famous, they put a red flag on his name so, when he crossed an Italian boarder, italian IRS officers sized his diamond earrings.

Next time you come to Italy just be careful: being you resident in another country, if you get pulled over you have to pay the fine on the spot. END"

" Q: Tow company scam
T: GOOD
B: I moved into a new apartment complex a few months ago.  It has assigned permit parking, and an assigned tow company to tow anyone not in the right spot.  Lately, I have been seeing a rusted out vehicle in my parking spot overnight.

When I called the tow company the first time a few weeks ago about this car, they told me that they cannot tow it, and to park my car in any other empty spot in the lot.  In the morning, my car got towed, and I was out $150.

I been speaking with some of the other tenants, and it has happened to them as well.  I approached the property manager, and she got real confrontative.

Time to time, this car appears in my spot, and I have to pay for hourly meter parking elsewhere to avoid getting towed again.  What are the next steps? [NJ]

###

","NAL, I would do the following:

1. Take pictures of the car in your spot, preferably with some sort of time stamp on it. (Might compare it to the car your neighbors have seen in their spot.)


2. Call the tow company to come get it; get the name/email of the person that you speak to. When they refuse email them something to the effect of ""in response to your call where you refused to tow an illegally parked car, I followed your direction to park in XYZ spot."" 

3. Contact management about it through e-mail and attach pictures of the car in your spot. (Encourage your neighbors to do the same.) 

4. You could leave a sticky note on the car that the next time you see it parked in your spot that you're calling a towing company.

5. I don't know if it would work, but you could try to call another tow truck company to get the car out of your spot. (Admittedly this one is up in the air due to other factors, but could be worth looking into.) END"

" Q: Ex’s gf keyed my car &amp; slashed my tires. Press charges, or resolve privately?
T: GOOD
B: This weekend (in SC) an ex’s gf slashed all 4 of my tires and keyed my car (every side/part of my car). The ex is asking me to not file a police report/charges against her. He wants to take the fall for it (basically to protect her legal-wise) and also pay for it because she doesn’t have the $. 

I’m wondering if she’ll be back to hurt me and/or my property again if she doesn’t face legal repercussions. As far he tells me, she’s scared that I was planning to press charges. (I haven’t had any contact with her directly- the ex is being the “messenger” of this).

However, when I looked at the process of filing a police report and pressing charges, it’s a long drawn out process (South Carolina). Right now, I’m working long hours and going to school so I legitimately don’t have the time or want the added stress of hiring a lawyer, going to court, etc. 

Honestly, I just want my car to be fixed. Would I be making the wrong (stupid) decision in the long term by letting him (ex) take the car to get it fixed, him paying for it, and just moving on with my life?  

Please let me know if you need any more info. Thanks so much in advance for any insight you can provide.

","Well . . . if all overt details are ignored, sure.  

But the numbers I provided are fairly conservative but very accurate.  OP's car is going to have to get towed to multiple places, installation and other fees haven't even been accounted for.  

If OP requested $50k, then there's something fishy going on (but not necessarily extortion).  The bad guy has the chance of not adding to their existing criminal record and OP has the chance of obtaining full replacement value without impacting insurance premium increases.

OP accepting $7,100 cash for this drama is equivalent to OP bending over backwards twice.  Ex BF has a chance to take care of both of the women in his life and be a hero.

EDIT:  Not filing a police report and paying for things out of pocket, was not OP's idea.  OP is being way too good of a person in this situation. END"
" Q: Neighbors pitbull just attacked my dog
T: GOOD
B: Took place in Alaska.

I took my dog Steve on a walk around the neighborhood about an hour or so ago when we came to a house that had a pitbull outside. I was quite a ways from the house when the pitbull came into the road and started running after us. 

I yelled out to the owner and asked if it was friendly to which she replied “yes” so they started sniffing each other for a second and then the pit just latched onto his neck and wouldn’t let go. She was trying to shock him with his color and I was screaming at her to grab him but nothing was helping so I told her I was going to shoot it and almost grabbed my gun but she yelled at me to try hitting it so I wailed on it’s head and it still wouldn’t come off so I had to kick it and one huge stomp to the head and he let go and the owner was able to grab it. 

I legit thought Steve was going to die, he never even tried fighting back once. He’s a very good boy he’s never showed aggression to any dog and is alaways on a leash he was just crying while it was latched around his neck. 

Luckily Steve is very fluffy so his fur saved his neck and I don’t even think the dog broke his skin. He had a tiny scratch that was bleeding very little but it’s so small I can’t even find it. It may even have been from the other dog because theres blood was on top of my fist where I decked it in the face. 

Anyways I called animal control but it’s closed on sundays so I left a message reporting the whole thing. The owner of the dog put the dog in and then came out to give me water to pour on Steve to see how bad he was hurt. I could tell she felt bad and I really didn’t want to have to kick her dog like that but he would’ve have killed Steve otherwise. There’s kids that play around here it could’ve done that to one of them easily and they don’t have huge fur to protect them.

","So the dog had a shock collar on?  

A dog is friendly until it’s not and certain dog owners refuse to acknowledge any bad behavior in their pet — it is always the fault of someone/something else.

Get your pet checked out by a vet and ask the owner to pay for it.  

Contact anImal Control.

You will hear that dog aggression is not the same as people aggression but the victim dog is often with an owner who may get bit and there is an issue of redirected aggression.

Maybe this will be a wake up call for the owner to control their dog — and maybe not. END"

" Q: [CO] Landlord allowed stranger into apartment.
T: BAD
B: Hi everyone,

Please let me know if this post is against the rules and I will be sure to remove it or edit it to make it comply with your rules.

Earlier today, my friend woke up to find a strange man wearing all black and with a mask on in her apartment.

She was shocked and was not dressed and thought the worst. She tried to sneak out of the apartment through the front door (this man was in her bathroom rummaging about) but the man stepped out in front of the door and demanded that she explain what she was doing in her own apartment. 

She tried to calmly explain that she lived here, but the man said that she did not live there and demanded that she explain what she was doing there. 

He said that the apartment belonged to a friend of his and that the landlord had given him the key to enter into the apartment. 

She was able to talk him into letting her put some clothes on and let her go to the office to explain what might be going on and he eventually agreed. 

When she got to the apartment office, she found out that the landlords staff member had given him the key to get into the wrong apartment (my friend's apartment) and let him go in there without being supervised because someone had requested that he be let into her own (different) apartment.

Apparently this person that asked that the apartment office let her friend into her apartment did not specify which apartment it was, and her friend simply gave my friends apartment number as the one he needed to get into. 

The staff member at the apartment somehow didn't notice that the name of the person that gave permission to give out a key was different and just handed over the key to this guy and let him head up by himself. 

My friend is badly shaken by the fact that the apartment could just give out her key without doing some basic checks and is eager to move out. 

The guy could have been armed and might have shot her when he saw her or attacked her somehow thinking she was trespassing in his friends apartment. 

However, the lease has an early termination clause that means it will cost her a few thousand dollars to break the lease before it ends next year. 

I would like to ask if it might be possible for this early termination clause to be waived (and the full security deposit returned)  on the grounds that the apartment was negligent and has now created a situation where my friend is scared and doesn't feel safe in her own home.

For added context my friend is not behind on rent and has never paid rent late since she moved into her apartment.

Is this the kind of thing that small claims court is for? Or should she hire a lawyer to draft a demand letter for the security deposit and waiver of the early termination fee? Or can she ask that they pay for her to get therapy or something if she can't afford to move out?

Is there anything at all that she can do? Please let me know if she has any recourse.

My friend is badly shaken by the fact that the apartment could just give out her key without doing some basic checks and is eager to move out. 

The guy could have been armed and might have shot her when he saw her or attacked her somehow thinking she was trespassing in his friends apartment. 

However, the lease has an early termination clause that means it will cost her a few thousand dollars to break the lease before it ends next year. 

I would like to ask if it might be possible for this early termination clause to be waived (and the full security deposit returned)  on the grounds that the apartment was negligent and has now created a situation where my friend is scared and doesn't feel safe in her own home.

For added context my friend is not behind on rent and has never paid rent late since she moved into her apartment.

Is this the kind of thing that small claims court is for? Or should she hire a lawyer to draft a demand letter for the security deposit and waiver of the early termination fee? Or can she ask that they pay for her to get therapy or something if she can't afford to move out?

Is there anything at all that she can do? Please let me know if she has any recourse.

###

","Your friend should see if there is a tenant relations office in her local area and they may be able to give advice.

Have your friend document the timeline of everything that happened. That includes what happened, what was said, times, etc. Do this while the interactions are fresh. This is to help with writing a letter to the management company and/or to file a police report.

Try to make sure that any future communication with the rental office is done in writing (or email) rather than phone calls. Once you start doing the written only communication, the apartment knows you are serious.

At a minimum, what I would want from the office is:

1. Acknowledgement that they gave out her key to a stranger and allowed him to enter her apartment. In writing. 

2. What procedures they have put in place to prevent this from happening again. 

3. Rekey the locks on her door(s).

4. The rental office will pay for the installation of a tenant lock (keyless deadbolt that only has a knob on the inside) for the tenants exterior doors. This is more secure than a chain (in my opinion). 

5. Request the name of the person who entered her apartment. If you file a police report, this would be a good detail to have.

Your friend should check her lease for language about entry to the apartment. They have probably violated any entry notice wait time even though the guy didn't work for the office.

Since the office basically gave out a key to someone who came in and said ""apartment 202"" without confirming this was the correct apartment, resident name, and visitor, I don't think they are really going to be able to tighten up the security in a satisfying way. In the end it may take a letter to the office requesting the lease termination fee be waived and her lease be ended. END"

T: GOOD
B: First off, if it's not clear. We do not agree with the ""easement"" and the neighbor is nasty and we want nothing to do with him. 

So as stated in the title, mother was not told about any easements outside of utilities during signing/closing.  Neighbors were getting annoyed that we park in the driveway, our driveway, and eventually provided a court document signed by both previous owners and notarized. 

The house is the type of place where you get 99 year leases for like $1.  And the community actually owns the land, but she own the house.  We checked and the community housing authorities have no easements on record.

The access of the easement is pretty straightforward, ""joint driveway,""  but there is no termination date.  It states:
""This easement shall be binding upon heirs, executors, administrators, agents or assigns of the parties hereto and shall run with the land.""

So both current owners have no relation to the previous owners.  So how would she fit into one of those mentioned, heir/exec/admin/etc.

Note: The parties on the document have no relationship to the community housing authorities.  and that authority is not representated on the document.

","Good question. She is still considered to be an “assign” (from where you said ‘heirs, executors, admins, agents, or assigns’, so it’s still binding.

ASSIGNS, contracts. Those to whom rights have been transmitted by particular title, such as sale, gift, legacy, transfer, or cession.

So even though she is the property owner of the house and the driveway is on leased property, she still has to comply with the easement, unless she can get a court order stating otherwise. END"

","Was that paper filed in court and approved by a judge???    Did they properly get the easement registered on the deed and plat?      If not then it means nothing.     
They could not even file it now since the person that signed is no longer an owner.    

1st step ask them for a copy of the document and pay a lawyer to review and verify that it is a real document.    
If they refuse to give you a copy or let you take a picture of it then it is most likely fake.    

Also, if the previous tenants were just leasing and not owners, then they cant legally sign a deal for an easement so the document cant be real.    Again get a copy and pay a lawyer to review it. END"

","The part where it says “runs with the land” means it’s binding on new and future owners. A title search should have shown any easements or servitudes, especially since it’s a public record from what you disclosed here (that it’s a court document). You may want to contact the title insurance company she used when buying the house. As it stands now, you really don’t have any choice but to comply with it until you can get things sorted out.

","What state is this in?

What type of business is this?  Who was it that calculated the valuation of it being worth $1.4 million?  Does the trust document actually have language in it that gives the trustee the authority to sell it or close it?  Verbal agreements are worth nothing when the trust must be administered--the language of the trust must be strictly followed.

Does the company have a person in charge who is running/managing things or is that you?  What are the monthly payroll expenses? Someone in the accounting department should be preparing monthly income statements that would show how much per month the business is making in net income/profit (the money that is left over after expenses have been paid).  Is there enough business cash available for someone to start paying off the credit card debt and the accounts payable?  The $160K in accounts receivable is far too high, but certainly understandable.  It means that the company has been too trusting of its customers to let them go too long without paying their bills on time--you can correct that situation by having someone in the A/R department to start aggressively making collection calls to ask for your money or by hiring a debt collection company to do the same thing, and if they are successful in collecting this could be a good source of future income for this company.  From this day forward, the customers your company does business for should be asked to put up a partial advance deposit before you do the work for them.  That will be an indication of their ability to pay and their willingness to pay.  Discuss all of these business aspects with the accountant you have worked with in the past (or with an accountant who has experience with businesses) and that person can advise you about what the business should be doing.

You can not let the beneficiaries or anyone else, prevent you from selling the business.  After you have worked the numbers with the accountant, you will be able to see in black and white whether the business can afford to continue or not.   I'm glad that you were able to at least mention some of the numbers involving the business operations, since that means that you are being informed about what is going on there.

If the trust does not name anyone to be a successor trustee, then you will have to consult with a trust attorney to figure out how a new trustee can be chosen.  The attorney can also help you figure out how to interpret the will and the trust--they are two separate documents that will be handled differently--the will will be handled in probate court and the trust will be managed privately, outside of court.

" Q: My neighbor is convinced I control owls (AZ)
T: GOOD
B: I live in a rural area that has coyotes, wildcats, owls, hawks, snakes, and even bears. 


My new neighbor has five very small dogs. She likes to let them roam on their own in her yard. When she first moved in she heavily insinuated that the family of barn owls that live in the tree in my yard were my personal property. She also insinuated that I have some sort of power over them. 


Two weeks after she moved in, was the owl incident. A juvenile barn owl smashed himself into my house, dazed and concussed he ended up in the neighbor's yard. I warned her about the owl, told her that he looked like he was starving, and to keep her dogs inside. Typically barn owls do not eat anything bigger than a rat. But she let her tiny dog's charge it and bite at it. Animal control couldn't come out, so I found a wildlife rehabilitation facility and caught the owl with the help of my husband. The poor thing was malnourished and had been wounded for a while, he had a damaged wing.


Tonight she asked us to come outside at 9pm to talk to her about the hawks in the neighborhood. Even after being told multiple times that the birds in our tree are barn owls, she kept calling them hawks. Asking if we could put a fake owl in our tree to scare them off. My husband and I have indoor cats, and we feed song birds to entertain said cats. She asked why we were feeding the hawks. I reiterated to her again, that they were barn owls who do not eat anything bigger than small rats.


I have seen a few hawks around our neighborhood, but again it is a very rural area. Her yard is filthy and overgrown. My husband and I think that's what is attracting mice and rats, and then attracting raptors who want to eat said rodents. 


I suspect that she is trying to establish precedent in case one of the many, many wild animals in our neighborhood eats one of her tiny dogs. On Monday I'm calling animal control, Fish and Wildlife, and our HOA to see what we can do to protect ourselves. We are also going to take a break from feeding the song birds in case they are attracting hawks. I plan on taking pictures of her overgrown and filthy yard. Is there anything else I should be doing to protect my husband and I?

","If a hawk, coyote, or some other beastie does hurt her dogs, before she is successful in a suit, she would need to prove you are responsible. A judge is not likely to believe you are responsible for behavior of wild hawks. That said, consider getting some cameras for your yard. It can show that y'all aren't running some hawk hotel and that y'all are doing nothing to incite local wildlife to hurt her dogs. Keep a written record of your contact with her, including dates and times, so if you go to court, you have a history of what has occurred. END"

Furthermore this company has also told us they will not be doing any repairs or fixing issues due to COVID and instead we are recommended to find a company ourselves and pay them ourselves and they will reimburse us up to a certain amount ""at their discretion"", however will not explain to us what this amount is. 

Is this legal?

" Q: Elderly neighbor's unsettling behavior is sharply escalating (Vermont).
T: GOOD
B: Hey, all. 

I live in Vermont. I moved in maybe four or five months ago (time has lost all meaning during lockdown) to a new building. The day I moved in, I met a seemingly-nice old lady. 

She helped me out one day when I was locked out of my apartment, and I left a thank you note and a small candy gift outside her door. Everything was polite and nice. 

But then she started asking favors of me, scaling it up from one quick errand to a significant amount of chores, shopping, cleaning, etc. I told her I was on disability for a reason -- I have both physical and mental health disabilities -- and she made some rude comments insinuating I was lying about my depression.

She also started to try to sell me on her religion. She wanted to ""lay hands on"" me to ""heal [my] migraines"" and implied it would heal my depression as well. I politely declined and she asked about my family's religion. When I told her what it was and it was different than hers, she made faces and a few disparaging remarks, and ever since then has been trying in earnest to convert me, telling me my family's religion is fake and sinful and we're all going to hell and that my late grandparents are in hell.

By this time I'd known her for about a week, and she started saying ""I love you"" to me. Repeatedly. And I knew it was time to cut contact.

It was then that I started trying to distance myself from this woman. I asked her several times specifically *not* to get things for me at the store, but she would come to my door and hover outside it for minutes at a time, listening through the door -- sometimes while I was on zoom doing my therapy sessions, other times right around midnight -- and when I'd open the door to tell her to go away she'd act like she'd just gotten there and I hadn't heard her squeaky walker and shuffling feet come up the hallway ten minutes earlier and stop right outside my door. Then she'd give me things I'd asked her not to buy me.

I stopped reciprocating with thank-you notes and return gifts when she gets me things I have asked her not to get me. I blocked her number and deleted the increasingly passive-aggressive voicemails because they made me uncomfortable (and were also filling up my mailbox). If I saw her in the laundry room and she hadn't spotted me, I'd leave as quickly as I could.

But sometimes she does spot me, and on several occasions she has blocked my exit from the laundry room or blocked me from going up the stairs to get away from her and gotten right up in my face. It's like a switch has been flipped. She's passive aggressive, she's outright aggressive. This little old lady scares me.

And every time she corners me in the hallway, she starts calling me incessantly again. 

It's been four or five months now. I blocked her number about two weeks into all this. Three weeks ago, I sent her a text asking her to not contact me again (she told me she texts her grandchildren and whatnot so I know she got it, she just didn't reply). Today I left a letter on her door. It was not rude, I did not insult her -- it just said something like ""hello, I have asked you multiple times not to contact me. Please stop calling my voicemail, coming to my door, leaving me things, etc. I want no further contact, not even for you to come to see me about this note.""

Then a little while later I came out of the elevator and bam, there she was. I tried ignoring her but she started following me. I asked her to leave me alone multiple times, but she kept saying, ""no, no,"" and I kept repeating myself: leave me alone. She started giggling madly then, and said in a sing-song, admonishing voice, ""you're *grumpy.*"" I told her I wasn't grumpy and that I wanted to be left alone. She said no over and over again and I tried to leave through the front door when she reached out to grab my arm to stop me.

That really scared me, as I grew up in an abusive household, and so before I even realized it I had yelled ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" That yell was enough to freeze her for just an instant, and I slipped out the door and out of the building. She yelled after me, ""*I'm going to report you!*""

**#TL;DR:**

Neighbor lady was friendly at first, then scary. Blocks my exit and gets into my personal space. Does not listen when I have asked her not to contact me. Is now threatening to report me because I yelled at her to leave me alone when she was trying to grab me while I was trying to get away from her. 

How do I go about getting a restraining order when our interactions have been in person ever since I blocked her number? I don't have the voicemails and she's never texted me.

","It sounds like this woman's mental state is deteriorating. Call your local adult protective services and ask for a welfare check. If you feel threatened enough to call the police specifically request that they send an officer who has been through CIT (Crisis Intervention Training) as they are more likely to listen to your concerns about her behavior and make contact with her family/local mental healthcare professionals to get her help.

If you notice any of her family members visiting share your concerns with them too. END"

B: NH, USA. As the title says, I recently filed a claim with the bureau of elderly and adult services due to a situation where I think there is neglect present. In any case the situation is really really bad, and, as a mandated reporter and dedicated advocate, I filed a claim. Upon being investigated, the manager of this program launched a counter-investigation against me, claiming I had been acting ""creepy and weird"" with the client for whom I am advocating.

" Q: Ohio Real Estate Question: what kind of scam is this?
T: GOOD
B: Hi All-

My wife and I own a house that we are rehabbing in one of the big cities in Ohio.  This is not our primary residence; however, once the rehab is done, we intend to move in and make it our primary residence.  We have a mortgage on the place to pay for the rehab, so it's gone through an exhaustive title search.  (With this mortgage and a grant program, there are liens on this house that approximately equal or are greater than its value in its present condition.)  In its current condition, it is not livable- there is no running water, no walls, no flooring, no ceilings.

This neighborhood is gentrifying and as a result investors really want properties there.  We've had literally hundreds of people call asking to buy the place... we've had lots of complaints to city code enforcement in the hopes that we'd get tired of them and unload the place.

On Friday, my contractor called me and said that some guy dropped off a weird letter to one of his guys who was working on the place.  He asked me if I knew what was going on, and I had no idea.  The letter is handwritten and it reads:

&gt;July 17, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;NOTIFICATION OF EVICTION  
&gt;  
&gt;To whom it may concern:  
&gt;  
&gt;On this seventeenth day of July 2020, all tenants, occupiers, occupants, residents, dwellers, lessees, and renters are provided a 10-day notice of eviction.  
&gt;  
&gt;The premises must be vacated by August 3, 2020 or further legal action may follow.  
&gt;  
&gt;This property has been claimed by Mr. A--- F--- who can be reached at (---) --------  
&gt;  
&gt;Candidly,  
&gt;  
&gt;A---- F----

The actual property address is not on the letter.  I really didn't think anything of this- I thought it was a prank or scare tactic or something.  But then the guy came back, walked around the inside, and *stole the key to the house*.  Unfortunately due to Covid, the police department in this city is not doing any in-person contact except for immediate emergencies.  They directed me to leave my number on a voicemail and an officer would get back to me.  I haven't heard anything yet.  I have changed the locks on the front door, but the side door is still accessible by removing a piece of wood that covers the doorway.

I'm utterly confounded about this.  I triple checked the county auditor (property is still in our name), county recorder (no new liens have been recorded), all local and regional court sites- no pending lawsuits against us that I can see.  The legal requirement for squatter's rights in Ohio is inhabiting and improving and abandoned property for 21 years.  As far as I can see this guy has no legal right to our property whatsoever.  Unless somebody many years ago did a ""deed in a drawer"" trick and never had ownership transferred.  But why does this guy even think he can do this??

Is this a case where he can hire an attorney to make our life hell, and then say, ""Hey you know this is going to cost you $50k to litigate but I'll be happy to settle for $5k"" deals?  Or is this such a clearly cut-and-dry case that a judge would grant a motion to dismiss?  Do I need to keep stalking the website of the Eviction Court in this city to make sure he's not trying to do something stupid like sue the house itself or serve papers to a place that is clearly uninhabited?

What I'm more worried about is that he'll try to take the property by force.  If I'm working there (or if my contractor is working there), this guy can show up, call the cops, and claim that I am trespassing on his property- then the cops would force me to leave.  That would be annoying if it happened once, but he could do this repeatedly until I was able to establish with the police that he is not the owner- and that might take a court appearance.

","My guess is this is some sort of Sovereign Citizen craziness.

&amp;#x200B;

""It sounds like the (Ohio 314) individuals may have  been engaging in Sovereign Citizen 'squatting.' Though the Sovereign  Citizen movement has been around for 45 years, in one form or another,  sovereign squatting is a relatively new tactic, dating back only to  about 2009, with the beginning of the mortgage/foreclosure crisis,""  Pitcavage said.

""It began with sovereigns  identifying homes that were vacant, the bank having evicted previous  residents but not yet resold the home. Typically, sovereigns would then  file bogus paperwork claiming to own the home in question, then move in,  changing the locks and putting sovereign paperwork on the door or  windows.""

" Q: Evicted Unlawfully for a Suicide Attempt off Premises
T: GOOD
B: Hi Smart Folks,

I'm currently at a crossroads. Earlier this month I attempted suicide in a local park. While I was recovering in Hospital my housemate let me know I wouldn't be living in that house anymore and I was terminated from the lease. All possessions were removed the day after I was released and I was told I would be getting my deposit back.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've realized this was fishy. I've reviewed the lease and there is no clause for conduct outside of the residence. Further, I believe I'm entitled to a prorated portion of my rent for this month - my key was collected and I was told I was not welcome by my housemate.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have not heard from my landlord and I still have not been furnished a notice of eviction, some week plus later. My questions are as follows

1. Am I entitled to my rent back, since I was not allowed to enter the house, had forfeited the key, and was operating under the assumption that my landlord was aware of this, and not just this housemate.
2. Am I entitled to recoup the costs of the AirBnB's I'm burning through trying to get through this month, am I entitled to compensation for costs associated with what is very obviously a bogus eviction?
3. If this was mismanaged by the houseemate, can I sue him directly, is that advisable?
4. What the fuck do I do?

I bet you get real estate or property all the time and this is boring. If it's of any consolation, I tried to hang myself and this guy didn't even wait a full 24 hours before telling me I would have nowhere to go when I got out, which is super dramatic and very unchill.

" Q: My mom is still collecting child support for my niece even though my niece is no longer living with her. This feels illegal. Is it?
T: GOOD
B: I live in Colorado. I understand that laws vary in states so that’s why I’m saying what state I’m in. My niece is turning seven years old next week. Wow they get big so fast! 

When my niece was only 5 months old, my sister had signed over temporary custody to my mom because she was in an abusive marriage with her ex-husband at the time and needed help with the baby so she could leave him and get her life straightened out. Mind you, it was supposed to be TEMPORARY. My sister tried to get her back when she was 8 months old the first time she tried. It wasn’t even that long! She was about a year and a half old when sister tried again.

Sister has had deal with this nonstop since she made the mistake of giving temporary custody to our mom because she thought she could trust her and is still dealing with it but now worse. My mom is stealing child support from Niece. 

Sister has had Niece living with her since after her sixth birthday and my mom has not given a dime of Niece’s child support money (from her father) to my sister to help her out with basic needs. Mom technically still has legal temporary custody still but Niece is living with sister. Right at this moment, Niece barely has any clothes that fit, (I bought her some for her birthday this year) she needs new shoes, soap, you know basic needs! Stuff that would be easy to get if my mom wasn’t hoarding Niece’s child support money. 

It seems illegal that Niece has been with Sister for nearly a year now and she hasn’t seen a dime of that money. Is it illegal?? What can Sister do about it????

Is that a wise decision, given that clearly someone, with intentions you're unaware of, is tracking your wife? Take it to the police station, try to fill out a report, press them to fill out a report, and when the person who placed it sees that it's at the police station, perhaps they will stop their shenanigans.

" Q: Mechanic's wife has my motorcycle...
T: GOOD
B: A while back I had a mechanic pick up a motorcycle to be assembled and finished. He took the bike from his shop to his home to work on during the weekends and time off (was a large project). Mechanic has been working on my bike for months at this point.

A few days ago I got a call from my mechanic saying his wife filed for divorce, locked him out of his house, and got him arrested for domestic assault. My bike is now stuck at the house and his wife won't let the bike be retrieved. He then gave me his wive's attorney's contact information to try and retrieve my bike. I contacted the attorney and was given this response: 

""I have learned a few things, and I do understand how much you’d like this resolved, and quickly!
 
I feel confident we will be able to make arrangements for you to retrieve your motorcycle, and I just need to ensure how best to do that while also seeing about getting the work done you paid for. Please bear with me a few more days while I try to make this happen smoothly.""


My questions are this... Do I have anything to worry about? I really just want my bike out of the middle of this. Can I demand to pick it up ASAP?

thank you in advance for the advice.

###

","The issue is that the bike has not been stolen, so this is a civil issue and the police probably won't care.  

I'm going to hazard a guess, reading between the lines, that the lawyer is going to arrange for the bike to be transferred back to the mechanic because he doesn't want the wife to be involved in whatever agreement there is between you and the mechanic. The lawyer probably doesn't want to give it back to you directly due to liability. [EDIT: /u/ErikLovesBallons also mentioned that the income derived from the bike repair will help his client, so there's actually a vested interest in getting the bike back to the mechanic so he can begin working again.  EVERYONE wants that bike back to the mechanic, including OP in another comment!]

That's actually ~~the proper way~~ one good way to deal with this, in my (non-legal) opinion. Then you can deal directly with the mechanic, as you normally would have anyway.  INAL. END"

","Last thing to do here is start demanding stuff. Considering its a divorce related to potential assault charges, I think everyone in that mess wants all things to be frozen until they have an idea of what's happening moving forward. I think simply your bike is not in the middle of this, it's more off to the side and they just can't arrange anything until they know what's happening with the divorce.

In my eyes this all checks out fine, Lawyer sent you in writing that you will be getting your motorcycle back with repairs finished.. so I mean there's not much they can say against you now END"

" Q: Undercharged Tenant of 35 Years cannot Leave Apt that needs to be Gutted
T: GOOD
B: This is New York (not the city). My father owns a house split into two apartments, one upstairs one downstairs. The upstairs is very nice because each of my brothers has lived in it and fixed it up very nice. The downstairs is another story. 

The downstairs has been occupied by an older women who paid about $180-200 35 years ago and increased to what it is today, $300/month.  She is now in the ending stages of her life. The apartment is also falling apart. She has been delinquent in reporting small issues until they are huge issues, but my dad has always corrected them when he sees them. Now it has become so bad that the entire bathroom needs to be gutted. The floor under the toilet is not sturdy. A leaking issue was recently corrected by tearing open a wall. 

Tenant wants my father to replace the wall because of course, she doesn’t want to look at it. She asked my father to fix it and he said he needs to gut the entire bathroom, but to do that she would have to move out for a time so it can be gutted and made safe again. She said she will not because she has no where to go. 

The tenant’s adopted son recently disowned her because the tenant’s son and his wife found his biological mom and discovered that bio mom is very wealthy. To curry favor with the bio mom (for some inheritance) the tenant’s son completely ditched his adopted mom (my dad’s tenant) and now the tenant has no one. She receives $600/month and half of that goes to rent. 

My father has no clue what to do because the apartment is not safe, but cannot be fixed with her living in the apartment and she says she has no where to go. 

What are his options in this situation? The tenant has been on a month-to-month for decades. I told my dad he should be worried that the apartment is unsafe and if anything happens to his tenant, that adopted, money-grubbing son of hers would sue the pants off of him. What can he do? Just ask her to leave because she is on a month-to-month lease? Does he have to pay for a hotel while he guts the bathroom? 

This seems like a no-win situation, my dad doesn’t want to kick her out, he can’t have her live in an unsafe apartment, he can’t afford to put her up in a hotel, he hasn’t made any profit from the apartment because he hasn’t wanted to ask her to pay more because he knows she can’t pay it. What is he supposed to do to protect himself?

###

","He has no responsibility to her once she has moved out if he terminates the tenancy correctly. Do keep in mind he is liable for injuries that arose from the current state of the bathroom and unsafe conditions present, which she may bring to a landlord tenant board and have him fined for not fixing. You must give her a one month notice due before the rent date prior where it's effective. So if you want to get her out by Sept 1st you'll have to give your notice before Aug 1st, make sure to do this in writing not verbally, have a paper trail going. The son can sue anyone for anything, but he will have a hard time proving damages. Also this will probably put him in a bind with his rich bio mom if he's all of the sudden coming back to help his adopted mom, so he might just continue on the same path since he is greedy. You're only other option is to pay for a different accommodation for her (like a motel) while the renovations are taking place, but that is a terrible idea financially and you have no lease which requires that, terminating the tenancy is the ""cleanest"" option for you to avoid liability.

" Q: My brother is dying of cancer and his wife is selling his meds
T: GOOD
B: My older brother is dying of stage 4 colon cancer. He will literally pass anyday now.

I went to visit him last week and he was so bad off. Apparently worse than other's had seen him. I found out his wife has not been taking him to chemo, not feeding him, and selling all his meds. She's a huge junkie. She literally texted my grandma ""I have the lock box with his meds. Good luck!""

I went to visit the place where they reside with a newborn and 5 year old. I was crying. It was disgusting. I can't put into words how awful this place was. She apparently leaves the newborn and 5 year old with my brother and parties all night. Rotten foot, dead bugs everywhere, clothes stacked to the ceiling. Meanwhile she goes out with some other guy and leaves my brother who can barely hold his head up with the kids.

I called CPS that moment. I've never done it before.

I find out today she took the kids and ran. I'm terrified for them. CPS is apparently looking for them. I'm also scared because apparently she took out a life insurance policy against my brother. I feel she is intentionally letting him suffer to get this money.

There's no way to contest this, is there? I want the life insurance policy gone but she's his wife so I don't know if it can even happen. How can I help these kids?

They live in Hattiesburg, MS and I'm in Birmingham, AL.

###

","My advice as a social worker: I would suggest that you also contact [Adult Protective Services ](https://www.mdhs.ms.gov/adults-seniors/adult-protective-services/) in Mississippi and report your brother’s wife for medical neglect of a vulnerable adult who is dependent on care.

ETA my husband’s advice as a life insurance actuary: If she legitimately took out a life insurance policy with his consent then she is entitled to the payout as long as she is not found criminally negligent in a way that contributed to his death and there was no fraud in taking out the policy. If the policy was taken out in the last two years and the cancer diagnosis was already known and hidden from the life insurance company, they may deny the claim. END"

I went to visit him last week and he was so bad off. Apparently worse than other's had seen him. I found out his wife has not been taking him to chemo, not feeding him, and selling all his meds. She's a huge junkie. She literally texted my grandma ""I have the lock box with his meds. Good luck!""

I went to visit the place where they reside with a newborn and 5 year old. I was crying. It was disgusting. I can't put into words how awful this place was. She apparently leaves the newborn and 5 year old with my brother and parties all night. Rotten foot, dead bugs everywhere, clothes stacked to the ceiling. Meanwhile she goes out with some other guy and leaves my brother who can barely hold his head up with the kids.

I called CPS that moment. I've never done it before.

I find out today she took the kids and ran. I'm terrified for them. CPS is apparently looking for them. I'm also scared because apparently she took out a life insurance policy against my brother. I feel she is intentionally letting him suffer to get this money.

There's no way to contest this, is there? I want the life insurance policy gone but she's his wife so I don't know if it can even happen. How can I help these kids?

They live in Hattiesburg, MS and I'm in Birmingham, AL.

","Besides the advice already given about adult protective services, you also need to see if he'd be willing to designate someone other than his wife as the medical decision maker -- the hospital won't necessarily know that she's a fugitive, and if she wants to cash in the life insurance policy she may intentionally sabotage his care. 

If the kids are found, you or another family member could seek custody and sue for child support to at least secure a piece of the life insurance money. END"
" Q: Girlfriend (21) was sexually assaulted by her ""Mentor"" (57)
T: GOOD
B: Atlanta, Georgia

My girlfriend (21 - I'll call her Sarah) and I met our Junior year of college. We are both ambitious people and made the most of our professional development in college by attending company events, conferences etc. At a conference, Sarah met someone that would enter our lives as her mentor, and later would be somewhat of a mentor to me by association. I'll call this mentor Bobby (Male 57 year old). Bobby calls himself a christian man and is very involved in church with his wife as relationship counselors for newly engaged couples. He is also very successful in his career, sits on millions of dollars and has a lot of connections at big companies. Sarah is very strong in her faith and saw Bobby as a great mentor for her spiritually and in her professional development. They began meeting for lunch and discussing personal growth and overall life goals. Before long, Bobby had gained Sarah and I's trust. He was becoming a mentor to me (when I was around Sarah) but never reached out to me like he did with her. We would come to him with relationship advice and trusted his guidance as a counselor, even though he would favor Sarah's side even when she knew she was wrong.

Fast forward to us graduating college and starting our careers. Sarah gained gained absolute trust in Bobby and began to see him as a father. Hell, I even looked up to the guy. We were looking somewhere to live in a metro area to be close to work. Bobby lives in a more suburban area away from the metro area, but this didn't stop him from suggesting that we look for apartments in the town he lives. After looking, Sarah decided her favorite apartment was one which was around a mile away from Bobby and his wife's house. I told her that the location was much further away from the metro area, and that it would be mildly inappropriate to move so close to this guy that takes an unusual and eccentric interest in her professional development. After not coming to agreement of a better place to live, Bobby invited her to come sign the lease, and spent 45 minutes on the phone manipulating her into thinking that this was a choice she should make on her own and independent of me. He also suggested she sign the lease and tell me after.

I lost a lot of trust because of this and told her that he was manipulating her, and wanted her close to him. I also thought the situation was getting creepy, and that he had surpassed me in Sarah's loyalty. I talked to Sarah about this and told her that I'd move in, but we need to limit contact with Bobby because he influences her to do things which are not good for our relationship. She agreed. With all the trust I lost over the signing of the lease, I became hypersensitive to what Sarah was doing and was monitoring her, catching her in little white lies left and right. We constantly fought about my loss of trust in her, and with no where to turn we phoned Bobby, who again took her side. He called me and had a one on one after our joint call, and told me that I needed to work on trust. At this point he would come over when I was not there, and help Sarah set up investment accounts. He would invite Sarah to run in the mornings without me knowing the next few days after my one on one phone call, and would say that I am not the right guy for her and that I may be the devil (lol).

A couple of days later, he invited Sarah over to have a one on one with him in person. He said that I can't know about it, and that she needed to hide it. When she arrived he had wine ready out back for them to have their talk. He began saying that Im not the guy Sarah should marry, and that I'm not good for her. He mentioned that he normally mentors people in a few areas, and that sexuality was one of them. He said he and Sarah hadn't touched that topic. He then began asking about sex and pushed for details. Bobby insisted that Sarah didn't know what it was like to be pleasured. He suggested that she needed to leave me and masterbate in a special way to release the pain of breaking up with me. Sarah was starting to feel weirded out, but followed him in the house when he said they needed to talk inside and that he would ""talk her through what he meant"". She asked why they couldn't stay outside, but he insisted, stating that ""nothing would happen in there, don't worry"". She reluctantly followed and sat down on a couch in his basement. He placed himself right next to her almost touching her. She began to cry about our relationship and said that she needed to pray. He placed his hand on her knee and held her hand- I had seen him do this before in a father-daughter fashion when she was distraught. She didn't think much of it until he reached up her dress and tugged on her spandex. She pulled away and he noted that everything was okay and that she didn't need to worry. She continued crying on the topic about us when she suggested maybe she should meditate about it. ""Yes lets meditate!"" exclaimed Bob. He forcefully tugged her in and began to kiss her head, cheeks, forehead and then began to position her head as he went in for the lips. Sarah freaked out and said it was getting late and rushed up the stairs and out the door. ""Well, goodnight then"" mumbled bob as she made her way out.

Sarah admits Bobby had groomed her and had an agenda the whole time. He was responsible for 90% of the pain points in our relationship, including the problems she felt the need to go to him to. We believe he engineered these predatory moves to groom, gain trust, and isolate her from me.

Note; This man has been married since college, he is 57. His wife was not in town the night of the incident. Sarah told me what happened a day later and that he was out of our life for good. We also payed the penalty to break our lease to move somewhere else.

With Bobby's status, wealth, and connections to our employers, we are scared to file a police report for sexual assault. We are also hesitant to even call his wife and tell her. Any advice on what to do moving forward would be nice, as still are inept to wrap our heads around the absurdity of this mans presence in our relationship.

","I read the entire thing and most of it was irrelevant.

Sarah is an adult. If she feels she was violated, she may report it to the police.

However,  I did not see any sexual assault in your post. Guy may have been a little ""creepy"", but it doesn't appear anything illegal took place so I'm skeptical the police can or will act.

If she's creeped out by the guy, she can cut him out. She's an adult. END"

","There's going to be a real issue of consent, here. She willingly went to his house. She willingly went inside. She willingly allowed him to get close. She willingly allowed the conversation to continue. He stopped when it was apparent she did not consent to further touching or any further sexual activities. There's just not much to hang a case on.

More over than that, while it's a technical violation of the statute, relatively, what harm was done here? She told him to stop and he did. Do you think a prosecutor is going to want to put those facts before a jury and hope they'll convict him? I imagine at least one of the twelve are going to think, ""Does this guy really deserve prison time for this? I don't think so."" Sure, that dude sounds creepy but the actions you've described aren't really on the scale of what that statute is designed to prosecute. END"

","Property Manager here, in New York, so completely different from Oregon. Hopefully this can still help. The management company I work for breaks down the rent make-up in a strange way due to the accounting system we use. Let’s say the rent base is $2000 and that is on your lease for what your monthly rent should be (before utilities, etc.). The resident would see a $50 balcony charge, $200 water view, $30 third floor fee. All in all, the base rent is still $2000, but the breakdown is given to show what the rent is comprised of. On top of that they would see minor charges for utilities and the breakdown would be there for water, sewer, and common electric charges.

I am not a lawyer, but I am a truck driver and I have to do that inspection and sign that form everyday I operate a truck. That transfers most of that responsibility to me as the operator and I can be fined and held legally liable if the truck is in an accident for something I overlooked.

" Q: [CA] Buyer refusing to close escrow, threatening to sue for 120k
T: GOOD
B: My grandmother owns a building from which she runs a struggling business in CA. Last year, she decided to finally sell the building since everything was going down the toilet and she could no longer handle the mortgage by herself.

Right away, she found a buyer. The buyer asked for an extended escrow (1 year) and that they would pay her $10k in advance per month, out of the deposit. The contract they signed stipulates that that money is nonrefundable.

However, over one year later, the buyer is now refusing to close escrow. They are also refusing to sign the contract termination form. It’s been over 8 months since close of escrow was supposed to happen. The buyer at first was ignoring her agent’s emails, then responding very rudely and flippantly.

My grandma scraped together what she could and hired a lawyer who basically did the bare minimum and is now refusing to pick up her calls. The lawyer told her that she needs to do arbitration/mediation, and when she consulted to try and do that, we were told it would cost her over $10,000+, money she absolutely does not have. So they have been at a stalemate.

My grandma just received a message from the buyer saying that they would only sign to terminate the contract if she returned the $120k fully to them. Additionally, they said that if she did not return the money, and agree to returning the money within 24 hours, they would sue her for every penny.

At this point, my grandma has received $120k total (1 year x $10k per month) which has all gone towards barely keeping us afloat. She no longer has a cent of that money. Returning that money is out of the question.

She cannot afford another lawyer.

I don’t know what to do. I am guessing they are just bluffing about suing her over the money, since the contract itself says it is nonrefundable. However, our fear is that they will hold the building hostage so that we cannot sell to anyone else and have to go under and lose the building anyway.

I am not familiar with any of the terms, so I am very sorry if I explain things poorly or misspeak. Please let me know if I can answer any questions.

","You are talking about amounts way over DIY level based on your post. Are buyers want all that money back plus to keep the property? Or are they just wanting a refund and to walk away from it?

","Your Grandma needs to speak with a real estate attorney before anything else. Those contracts that were signed originally need to be interpreted so she knows where she stands. Also, a real estate attorney will know what her rights are with regard to cancelling the contract in response to the buyer’s inability to financially perform. There are usually clauses in purchase contracts that have contingencies for these things.

Real estate attorneys cost a fraction of the $10,000+ that you were quoted. If she were to get sued, it would cost $10,000 + to defend herself however, if she can have a real estate attorney find a legal loophole, she may be able to figure it out without spending that much money. END"
" Q: Brother-in-law started fraudulent Gofundme after my partner died, stole all the proceeds and even sold her car without my knowledge and pocketed the money.
T: GOOD
B: Hi guys, so I'm kind of at the limits of my patience here... First, a quick synopsis: My partner passed away in early 2017 after a lengthy struggle with mental illness.
Her brother, despite not having any real contact with her during the last 7 years of her life (by her choice, not his) was present at her final moments with myself as I figured at her death bed wasn't the time to perpetuate long standing grudges and despite their issues he deserved to be there with her at the end.

After she passed, we discussed the future and, after a discussion between the two of us, he elected to start a gofundme in her name under the pretense of raising money for the immediate assistance of myself and the our two young children that she left behind.

Although I personally find the concept of cash for condolences to be a bit tacky and found it odd that he'd want to start immediately banging around the donation tin, I acquiesced and let him create the fund.

During the campaign, he raised around 9 or so thousand from friends and family, as well as pocketing cash handed to him at the funeral itself (her hometown has a large Italian population and apparently that is the norm?) and from selling her vehicle, despite promising not to do so without discussion with me as he had no legal right to do so and I was her only stated next of Kin.

Once the campaign had concluded, he and I entered into discussion as to how the Money would be Used, at which point he decided that, despite previous agreements and what he had initially stated on the gofundme, that he was now going to awkwardly insert himself into our fiscal matters and put the money into a fund for the children to access when they turn 18. He then amended the gofundme page from the original intention to reflect this change, which understandably upset some of those who donated thinking it would go to help the family during the time of struggle rather than go towards some arbitrary fund for the future. 

Despite ostensibly being to immediately assist us with the funeral costs and the like, I agreed to the creation of a fund on the sole condition that, if he insisted on retaining some element of control regarding the fund, then we BOTH get established as signatories, so to alleviate whatever concerns he had that I wouldn't use the money in a matter that he didn't agree with and, conversely, he wouldn't be able to do the same, as both of us would need to sign for anything.

He refused to give me any signatory power, despite me pointing out that by doing so would protect the fund from anyone being able to just dip in at their convenience, and after lengthy arguments it became clear that he never had any real intention of even creating the fund, despite his claims. 

He demanded to be the sole person in charge, despite having nothing to do with either myself or my children's lives up to this point, and the entire thing felt disingenuous and a way for him to try and retain power, as I couldn't see why, for both of our peace of mind, he wouldn't have myself, the children's only surviving guardian, involved in their fiscal fund at all, unless he intended to use the money for purposes other than what he was stating.

Long story short, I told the cockwomble to jog on and messaged those people that I could who had donated to pull their money out while they could and to keep it for themselves, of which about 3000 was removed from the gofundme in response.

However, with the 5000 or so left, he, promising to create a trust fund, absconded with the money and, to this day has never created any fund, particularly as he has no legal right to and doesn't even know my the dates of birth or full names of either of my children. He also, as mentioned above, sold my partners car without my permission and kept the money, despite me possessing the only title of ownership for said vehicle.

Disgusted, I pursued what legal avenues were available to me, but after reporting the case to the gofundme campaign to ACORN, the Australian cybercrimes division, I, after nearly a year and a half, have received notice that the acts he committed by obtaining funds through deceptive measures, somehow doesn't constitute fraud as clear intent can't be established.

In regards to the stolen car being sold off, I reported this to local authorities and was told that, as the property was considered part of a deceased estate, my only recourse was to pursue the matter in civil court as it didn't constitute a criminal offence, despite the fact that this fucking jizz stain literally stole the vehicle and sold it for his own profit.

I don't profess to know all of the intricacies of the law, indeed it's extremely convoluted, but in my eyes both acts are clearly cases of theft and profiting due to deception and fraudulent means, yet I'm basically told to eat shit and smile while I'm doing so by any law enforcement agency I've reported it to.

So, I'm curious if there is anything at all I can do or if I have been misinformed in some manner, as I frequently see people getting caught running gofundme scams yet this douchenozzle has got away with it seemingly scot free.

I don't care about the money at all, but I do care about justice and feel that it hasn't been served here; basically, from what I've been told, you can create fake gofundme campaigns and sell a deceased person's property out from under their surviving next of kin without any legal ramifications, which just doesn't sound right by any conception.

So, do I have any alternate avenues in which I can approach this situation? It's been going on 3 and a half years now and I just feel that  the legal system has let myself and my children down whilst literally rewarding the perpetrator with funds acquired under false pretense and off of selling stolen property.

Apologies for the extremely long post; I'm located in Australia, if that affects anything.

Cheers.

","Okay, so from more of a practical standpoint than a legal one...

I can't imagine your landlord has any legal right to compel you to produce a prescription.  However, he can choose to not renew your lease when your current lease expires, and he can even call the police if he thinks he should report you for drug possession.  If I were in your shoes, I'd probably just ask my doctor to provide a letter stating that (a) the syringes are required for administering necessary prescribed medication and (b) that HIPAA prevents him from sharing any further details regarding your diagnosis or treatment.  Even this kind of letter isn't something your landlord can require, but it would probably be the fastest, easiest way to get him to shut up and leave you alone. END"

" Q: Is my boss legally assaulting me? Did I do the right thing?
T: GOOD
B: New York

My boss and I have not had the best relationship. I believe he is unethical and I'm not afraid to tell him or his supervisor of his actions. For this reason, our relationship has been tense. But I am stuck between ""my boss is a man child"" and ""my boss assaults me"" and I don't know what to do.

Here is what happened. 

1.) In Feb of this year - his actions got out of control. On two occasions he made the attempt to spread the rumor that I am pregnant - first time was in front of our department. Second time was while I was conducting an interview. 

2.) Within this same week, he decided to throw his water bottle at me in the middle of a department meeting. He does this often when I am at my desk, asks me if I want to play ""52 card pickup"" and throws random stuff at me. I brush it off when he does it to me while I am at my desk but this what in a department meeting and I felt completely disrespected.

3.) Minding my own business, I was walking down the hall and I saw him walk down the opposite side. He sees me and proceeds ""in my lane"" running me into the wall. He then walks away. This is after the fact that I just took time off for a knee injury.

Since then:

I have filed a report with HR, spoke to his supervisor multiple occasions and even sought council from our on sight therapist who spoke with our executive. The actions they took against him was forcing him to attend leadership training. That's it. I felt like the way HR handled it was unjust and I have spoke to them multiple times about this. They said that I need to work on communicating to him better. 

Is my boss legally assaulting me or did HR handle it correctly?

###

","He is undoubtedly acting inappropriately, and that type of contact could certainly be construed as assault. 

That being said, HR has taken ***an*** action, albeit a minor one. Continue to track and document any issues and contact HR immediately to advise that the behavior is still ongoing. Also, be sure to note how you communicate your responses to any negative actions or gestures from your boss. Obviously, your legal case is stronger if their attempts to address have failed and his inappropriate behavior continues.

That is, if you choose not to consult with an outside attorney.  Or, if you feel you're assaulted, call the police - which would obviously have major repercussions... END"
" Q: Is my boss legally assaulting me? Did I do the right thing?
T: BAD
B: New York

My boss and I have not had the best relationship. I believe he is unethical and I'm not afraid to tell him or his supervisor of his actions. For this reason, our relationship has been tense. But I am stuck between ""my boss is a man child"" and ""my boss assaults me"" and I don't know what to do.

Here is what happened. 

1.) In Feb of this year - his actions got out of control. On two occasions he made the attempt to spread the rumor that I am pregnant - first time was in front of our department. Second time was while I was conducting an interview. 

2.) Within this same week, he decided to throw his water bottle at me in the middle of a department meeting. He does this often when I am at my desk, asks me if I want to play ""52 card pickup"" and throws random stuff at me. I brush it off when he does it to me while I am at my desk but this what in a department meeting and I felt completely disrespected.

3.) Minding my own business, I was walking down the hall and I saw him walk down the opposite side. He sees me and proceeds ""in my lane"" running me into the wall. He then walks away. This is after the fact that I just took time off for a knee injury.

Since then:

I have filed a report with HR, spoke to his supervisor multiple occasions and even sought council from our on sight therapist who spoke with our executive. The actions they took against him was forcing him to attend leadership training. That's it. I felt like the way HR handled it was unjust and I have spoke to them multiple times about this. They said that I need to work on communicating to him better. 

Is my boss legally assaulting me or did HR handle it correctly?

" Q: I purchased some furniture and never received it due to covid 19, store does not want to issue a refund
T: GOOD
B: I purchased several pieces of furniture from a big furniture company over 4 months ago. A few weeks after making my purchase I received a call from their shipping department saying that shipping would be put on hold due to covid-19. I'm disabled and immune compromised, so I understood since safety is a priority for me. I never received a new shipping date from them. After 4 months of not hearing anything back from them and having still not received any furniture, I called the company's customer service number to request that they cancel my order so I could get a refund. They said that I would have to speak with the store that I purchased it at, and that the store was now open (even though I had never heard back from them), and they would put my call through to them. I ended up speaking with the person who sold me the furniture and was told that they can not issue me a return or refund because I purchased some items that are final sale. They also said that they were waiting for Me to contact them to set up a new shipping date (which I was never told to do), and added that they could ship the furniture this week. My state just had a record high number of covid 19 cases, so as an immune compromised person I do not want to have anyone come to my home now. I told them this, and that I wished to cancel my order and get a refund instead since I never received any items after many months and was never offered a new shipping date when they originally stopped the shipment. They said that they had been shut down for 2 months due to covid 19 as a way of explaining this, but that just shows that they have been open for 2 months and have not reached out in any way to contact me during that time. Before calling them, I looked up what to do if you are billed for merchandise that you never received at the Federal Trade Commission website for consumer information, because I was unsure about what to do with this situation.

[https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received)

The Federal Trade Commission says that if a new shipping date is not offered in a month (it was not), and merchandise is never received (I never received anything), then a full refund must be issued promptly. I told them this, and where I got this information from, and they said that I would have to speak with a manager who was not in at the moment. I asked when they would be in, and if they could call me back. They said that they would be in tomorrow and that they would leave them a note, but did not know when they would be able to contact me. It honestly seems like they are trying to avoid issuing me a refund. I called my bank/credit card company to see if there was anything I could do in this situation and after explaining everything they said that I could dispute the charge based off the information of this situation. So now they are helping me to dispute the charge, and told me that hopefully it will be resolved soon based off the information from the case, and told me to call them back and let them know if the store decides to issue a refund after all.

I have never had to dispute a charge before, and have never been in a situation like this, so I am not sure if there is anything else I should do. I'm trying to take the right steps to make sure that I get a full refund for all the furniture I never received, but I worry that the furniture store will not want to comply or will make things difficult in some way. Is there anything else I should do or be aware of?

","You're incorrect. Furniture stores do not use the POS systems that places like Target use.  I managed a warehouse of a furniture store for 11 years (20 years total in the business) that made 12 million a year and issued all kinds of refunds at the front counter over the phone and in person.  You just click the return button at the sales transaction screen, enter in the invoice number, hit file, turn around to the credit card machine and ask the customer for their card number over the phone- return complete.   That's exactly what the sales person should have done. 

The items sold ASIS are not considered final sale until the customer take delivery and the furniture is in his home.  The sales person did not want to take a hit during covid because they are likely not making that much money right now. 

Just to be clear, I was talking about the sales person, not the customer service rep that works in their distribution center. END"

I couldn't find any specific regulations regarding protection from insect stings, but it's likely it would fall under one of the catch-all safety regulations. I'd recommend filing an OSHA complaint. They may make an inspection, and may order your employer to bring out an exterminator to eliminate the nests. Filing an OSHA complaint is a protected activity, and it would be illegal for your employer to discipline or fire you for doing so.

Aside from that, your employer can't *force* you to enter the building, but they can legally fire you for not doing so. If you refuse and are fired, you might be eligible for unemployment, but it's impossible to say for sure, since every case is handled individually. END"

They did CAT scans (No MRI) and found that he didn't have a stroke or seizure, hitting his head caused some bleeding in the brain and as it cleared up he was able to speak again. He isn't 100% better, he is still confused and screwing up when talking to people. I feel he was rushed out of the hospital before he was ready to make room for another patient.

 He was unable to get out of bed at the hospital, so his muscles got very weak, and he is no longer able to walk unassisted, or in general. His doctors recommended physical therapy, and the day he was discharged from the hospital I, my sister, and my mother drove him to the physical therapy/nursing home in our car (my mom couldn't afford to pay for the ambulance.) 

Here's where the problems start: The admissions manager at the nursing home told my mom they have strict COVID regulations in place to prevent their patients catching it (specifically every patient only works with one nurse) and all patients are placed under quarantine for 2 weeks. Once out of their quarantine the patients would have to be socially distanced, and in their rooms unless in specific communal areas. They told my mom that they hadn't had any COVID cases yet because of these safety regulations, and because they test all of their staff weekly. That all sounded great. But when we arrived we found out that this wasn't the case, and admissions was extremely unprofessional.

When we arrived the receptionist told us she was very new. We weren't greeted by any administrators or supervisors. There were nurses walking around the ground floor but they were ignoring us and going home. The receptionist looked up my dad's room, led me and him to an elevator and told us to go up to the ward upstairs. My mom and sister would follow me in the next elevator. I got upstairs with my dad, who by that point wasn't talking much, and walked out of the elevator into the ward. There were patients in wheelchairs, some with masks on, some without, all over the place. There were nurses milling around who didn't even acknowledge that I was there. No one noticed us until my mom and sister came upstairs, at which point they started to yell at us. Apparently the receptionist had allowed us into a closed ward that only patients and nurses are allowed in. They took my dad's belongings, told us a nurse would take care of him, and told us that we had to go back downstairs without him. We did not get a proper chance to say goodbye. 

When we got downstairs we were told to wait until the night supervisor could meet with us. This was several minutes. During this time another nurse came over to us and said ""I'm sorry, I know this is hard, I wouldn't want to do this with my grandpa either."" We pointed out that this wasn't my grandpa, this is my dad. We were furious. The night supervisor shows up dripping sweat. She introduces herself,  and explains we weren't supposed to be allowed upstairs but that they'll ""forgive it this time."" My mom tells her my dad has his medications in his belongings, and that the admissions person said that was fine. The supervisor freaks out, says patients are only allowed to have meds from the pharmacy on site, and runs upstairs to get them. She come's back and we ask her questions about their COVID policies (one nurse to each patient). She looks at us like we're insane and says they only do that for COVID positive people, and asks if my dad is COVID positive. We said no. I asked who the day supervisor would be and she didn't know. She just told us which room my dad would be in, and that he was being helped by a nurse. Overwhelmingly, it was a negative first experience and we were considering bringing him home first thing in the morning. I left thinking they might've lied to my mom about having no COVID patients as well, based on their reaction to our questions.

What I need legal advice on: This morning my mom gets a phone call from the nursing home that my dad fell out of bed and landed on his left side (the paralyzed side) and that he is being rushed to the ER in an ambulance. They don't know if he hurt his arm because he can't feel it, or if he hit his head again. There were no railings on the sides of the bed, or anything in place to keep him from falling. We don't know what time he fell, how long he was on the floor before someone noticed him, and if we're going to have to pay for this ambulance now. We don't know who will be responsible for my father's medical expenses if he was injured in this fall. The behavior of the staff was very unprofessional, and I'm concerned there was negligence involved. My dad is in the ER right now, and we don't know his status. I don't know what to do and really need advice. Again, this is in NY state if that makes a difference.

","Make a report to your state department of health. If the nursing home takes Medicare or Medicaid, file a report with them as well. Falls are preventable and there should have been measures in place for your father, who should have been immediately assessed as a patient at risk of falls (low bed, rails, movement alarms, pads on the floor, frequent checks etc). CMS and state department of health takes falls VERY seriously. It’s one of the metrics they use to assess quality. Also, any injury related to the fall would be the financial responsibility of the facility, so contact an attorney that can tell you your rights and make sure the hospital bills are covered. Also, I’d look into a new facility. Check the CMS website and you can search by quality measure for your area. END"

Which made sense, but I didn’t think much of it since it was a new construction. We decided to negotiate some repairs that they did find and then proceeded to closing.

Closing was pushed back multiple weeks because the seller had not gotten a building inspector to come through after they finished building the home. On the day of the closing, we did our final walkthrough of the home. Many things had changed about the house from when we last saw it. Like the doors opened in different directions and drywall was put up in the unfinished basement. We also found water along the floor of the finished basement. We had requested the house be cleaned because of Covid, so the realtor and us had assumed (again foolishly) that the water was from the cleaning. 

After we close, we go back to our new home and find that one of the aircon units in the basement is leaking water onto the basement floor. The other unit, we find is leaking water behind the new drywall that was put up in the unfinished basement. Like, there was literally a drain pipe just sitting there, leaking water onto the floor.

We had a service person come out to repair all the issues with the units and then presenting us with a pretty hefty bill. I am wondering if there is any recourse since there were many things that changed with the home after the inspection.

","Many times, new construction homes come with a home warranty, that can cover the issues you're describing.  If you look through your purchase and sale paperwork, you'll find out if one was included with your sale.  You might also want to reach out to your real estate broker to find out what they think.  If all else fails, reaching out to the builder might be a good idea.  Let them know that you're having problems with the home you just bought, and they may decide to help. Chances are they had a subcontractor install the HVAC, and builders don't like it when their subs don't do a good job. END"

T: GOOD
B: I work for a small employer (less than 50 employees). Each employee is salaried and exempt and has to log their hours. If you log less than 38 hours, then your PTO is docked in 4 hour increments. It doesn’t matter if you worked 7.25 hours for 3 days and 8 hours for 2 days, your PTO will still be docked for any circumstances where a full 38 hours is not logged. If you don’t have any PTO to use, then those hours are unpaid.

Beyond this, your project manager is responsible for assigning tasks to you. You are not allowed to work on or log time to anything else. So, for example, if your PM gives you 33 hours of tasking for the week, you cannot just then research or do something else in those missing 5-7 hours. So if your PM only gives you 33 hours of tasks for the week, your PTO will be docked or you will be unpaid for those missing hours.

Is this legal? Are there state rules at play here? I live in Florida where there are no time-off or PTO laws. If this is not legal, what can be done?

","&gt; if you have a “bona fide sick leave plan.”

I worked for a small company in NV where the founder/CEO was an Ayn Rand fanatic. He told everyone there would be no PTO because no one should expect to be paid while not working. He would also dock his salaried employees if they missed any time at all in 6-minute increments. He bragged he had gone through the birth of three kids without missing a minute of work.

HR eventually convinced him it was unlawful and he needed to give PTO before he could dock salaried workers; we started getting a resentful 5 days holiday/sick/personal leave each year which then qualified him to dock missed time (or so I was told). END"

","Making you use PTO is perfectly legal and you CAN not pay a salaried exempt for whole days if they have no “sick time” and they are out a full day sick if you have a “bona fide sick leave plan.” However, if the employee works AT ALL on one of those days they must be paid for the full day, regardless of available sick leave. Also, its unclear in law if a mixed vacation/sick “PTO” plan meets the definition of a bona fide sick leave plan so it may or may not be lawful to deduct pay for full days not worked. You’ll have to leave that in the hands of DOL if you file a wage claim.

Edit: Probably not going to take the pumpkin, I was just wondering if it's our pumpkin or not

###

","Most of the commenters in this thread are wrong. The pumpkin belongs to the neighbor and the pumpkin is trespassing. I commented this earlier and the AutoMod removed it as “bad or illegal advice.” But the automod is wrong. Source: I am a lawyer licensed in 2 jurisdictions. 

Here’s the analysis: the pumpkin plant and the roots are on the neighbor’s property. There is no dispute that the plant belongs to the neighbor. The new pumpkin is still connected to the plant. Therefore, the new pumpkin belongs to the neighbor. 

Think about this. If the neighbor had, say, a basketball hoop in her yard, and the wind blew the hoop over, it’s leaning against the fence, and it’s now hanging over the fence and extending into OP’s yard. We wouldn’t dispute that the basketball hoop still belongs to OP’s neighbor even though it’s hanging over OP’s property. So too with the pumpkin. 

If you go onto someone else’s land, or cause another person or thing to go on someone else’s land, that is trespass. You can check the Restatement of Torts. So the pumpkin plant, the property of OP’s neighbor, has entered onto OP’s land. That is trespass. 

OP’s remedy is to ask the neighbor to remove the pumpkin, and if the neighbor fails to, then OP could remove it. OP would be on safer ground to do this with a court order, but that’s not likely to be cost effective in this scenario. 

This is the same scenario as when a tree branch grows out over a neighbors yard and then the other neighbor saws the branch off and there’s a dispute or something. The pumpkin does NOT belong to OP. END"

" Q: Social worker crossed out my wife's answer for our mixed son's ethnicity on his Healthcare application
T: GOOD
B: This is a weird situation I've never really considered before. I'm a white male and my wife is Hispanic. As my wife was filling out the application for our son's healthcare she didn't know which ethnicity box to check for him so she just checked ""white"". The social worker told my wife she couldn't put ""white"" because she's not white. So my wife then marked both white and Hispanic and the social worker crossed out the white mark.

First of all, can the social worker do that? Secondly, what ethnicity should we put for our son in the future?

I live in California.

###

","Most of the time, questions regarding race are based on what you interpret your own race to be, otherwise a lot of people would be left wondering. Aside from that, often times forms like that have a category ""Hispanic - White"" and another ""Hispanic - Not White."" I would say your wife did as close to the right thing as possible in that situation, and it was inappropriate for the social worker to change it without discussing it. I'd call her office on Monday for some clarification, as there might be some different benefits based on your son's ancestry. END"

B: My father died about 2 weeks ago sort of unexpectedly (only started getting sick about 2 months ago), and I guess he didn’t have the time to write up a will. He has 6 children, me being the second youngest, and our mother passed when I was little. We live in Texas. To my knowledge nothing of my father’s estate was signed over to her, and they weren’t planning on getting married.

Today was the first time I tried bringing up the conversation of what we were going to do with the house, and she immediately flipped out and said she was planning on staying at the house indefinitely. Our dad only said that he wanted her to be taken care of financially, but we don’t even have a lot of money in the inheritance to be able to afford the house payments for more than a year or so. As of now, the money that is in my dad’s bank is auto paying all of the bills.

I don’t want to kick her out, but just today going over the place isn’t being maintained like my dad did, so I want to move back in to take care it as soon as I can. I’d be okay with her living there until a new plan is sorted out, but in the end she can’t just stay at the house forever right?

Having said that, have a look at [ARS s13-4051](azleg.gov/ars/13/04051.htm). It allows the court to make a “notation that the person has been cleared.” Such a notation would prevent all law enforcement agencies from releasing the records without a court order.

I should add that asking for an expungement, as other have suggested, would be fruitless, and is bad advice. First, Arizona does not have an expungement statute; it has a “set-aside” statute, which is far short of an expungement. Second, you can only “set-aside” convictions. You stated that the charges against your sister were dismissed, meaning that there are no convictions to “set-aside.” END"

When we get back we see immediately that someone has been in our room and stolen from us. They took a wallet with cash in it (about 900$) and a family heirloom gold and aquamarine ring (approx a 6carat pale blue emerald cut set in 14k gold) that is worth maybe 2k but honestly priceless to me as it was passed down from my late paternal grandmother as well as some prescription pills.

","Also NAL, also have motel experience.  These comments may get removed due to being considered anecdotal, but my experience was that guests do accuse housekeeping of stealing, many times these accusations are obviously false (i.e., the guest only decides they were robbed after they've been asked to leave to running naked down the corridors), and the front desk and managers have gotten to where they automatically mentally dismiss the accusations.  Offers to call the police--our manager would always offer--would almost invariably be shrugged off by the guest.  However, there were a few times when the guest persisted, the police were called, and a check of the key card reader showed that hey, someone unauthorized was in the room. END"
" Q: Oklahoma: HIPPA violation or not? Nurse faxed medical records to my stalker
T: GOOD
B: Hello there, I have had a stalker for about 10 years now. 
I started seeing a new doctor and my first appointment I reserved two time slots so I could explain the situation to the doctor and her PA (physicians assistant, for those who may be out of the country). Because of this, one of the things I talked to them about was that I wanted not a single person to receive my medical records unless it was me and I was there for them IN PERSON with my ID. The doctor reassured me that I had nothing to worry about, because HIPPA didn’t allow them to release records unless it was for another physician or if I was there in person to verify, that it was indeed me. 

Not even a month later I was informed that the PA had faxed my medical records to the business office of my stalker.
When I called to ask what happened. The PA was immediately defensive and extraordinarily rude, telling me, and I quote “you are not going to get me in trouble for this” over and over. I am a bit of a push over, and really just wanted to know what happened and what all was sent and why they didn’t verify the identity of the person calling. They were obviously not calling from my number on file so I have no clue why they would allow this to happen.

All this time I have wondered if she was right and if she was in her rights to do this or if what she did was illegal. 
I’ve changed doctors a few times since and haven’t had this happen to me but that very one time, even though my stalker is still active. 

Can anyone give me any legal insight on if this was a HIPPA violation or not?

","Yes, it is a very serious HIPAA violation.  To release medical records a hospital or doctor needs a signed release from the patient. These are routine in Personal Injury cases, and, even though plaintiffs are required by law to produce the records, hospitals will not send a scrap of paper until they have the release from the patient.  For a doctor's office to release records without a release to anyone, much less a third party they had been specifically warned about, is quite surprising.    
You should strongly consider finding a lawyer in your area to help you with this. You can file a HIPAA complaint with HHS.  A lawyer familiar with Oklahoma's privacy laws can advise you on whether you can potentially file a lawsuit, and whether the individual's actions are a crime (I don't know Oklahoma's laws on the subject, but in New York this would very much be a criminal violation of a protective/restraining order).

T: GOOD
B: I was tentatively hired, did a fingerprint background check. I have a clean record. Never been arrested in my life.

I thought I was in the clear, and emailed this letter off. Asking if they’d be able to move forward. 

Someone from HR called me and said I was fine, and good to go with the letter from court, but that they had to talk to their director because this was a little confusing for them.

I got an email today, from the director, stating that they are unable to move forward with my employment. 

That “We will need dispositions for the charges in the 1980s in order to make an accurate decision on employment. Once you receive closure on these, please feel free to resubmit. If I am able to clear the background, with the updated information you provide, you would be eligible to apply for positions at that time.”

" Q: Awarded 20k recruitment scholarship to graduate school turns into 5.7k
T: GOOD
B: Note: Throwaway

Hi guys. This is a throwaway account. I applied to multiple scholarships through my state university. I was awarded (an essay) need-based scholarship covering most of my tuition in March. I then applied to a separate scholarship form on their website that asks activities/interests/parent’s income etc. I completed it around March, too. At the end of April, I had to make a final decision between 4 schools. I received an email from my state school congratulating me an a merit scholarship worth 20k. Seeing as I had won the essay scholarship and it, too, was about half my tuition or 19k. I asked for a clarification that the recruitment scholarship wasn’t a need based one. I was then told it was in fact not and it was awarded through the Admission’s office. I was ecstatic and went ahead to finalize my decision with my State school. 

Fast forward to July. I get my financial award summary and I’m missing the 20k, instead I find 5.7k. Confused, I assumed the amount was from the separate scholarship I had applied to. I emailed the person who sent me the original letter for the recruitment award. They mentioned they would look into it and that there’s been more errors than usual this year. I get an email back saying the error was found. The letter wasn’t supposed to say 20k but actually 5.7k.

Seeing as I was the one who ultimately discovered the issue, are there any legal ramifications? I can’t accept any of my previous school offers. I initially emailed my financial aid office about the missing 20k. They called me back the next day and mentioned they hadn’t heard back from the Admissions office about my inquiry. Once I told them what happened, they sounded surprised and understood why the admins office hadn’t gotten back to them (cuz they f-ed up bigly)

","Is it PE? This looks like a simple offer of ""acceptance to school with a 20k scholarship"", accepted by agreeing to go to the school, and breach.

Because there is a letter it sounds like the best argument the school has is that of an illusory contract or possibly mistake.

The letter the student sent asking about the terms and the letter back go a long way.

If this student has five letters of acceptance, attended the school that offered on paper the most money and then that school walked the claim back, my first task would be to carefully read the scholarship letter as an Express Warranty. END"

T: GOOD
B: New York - My mother passed away in January, and she handled nearly all of my parents’ finances. I’ve taken the lead in figuring out their financial situation, and my sister has been helpful when necessary. (Dad, 73, is a lifelong severe alcoholic, has a permanent tracheotomy so he is unable to speak, never learned how to use a computer so he is unable to do anything with internet, and in general seems to have some learned helplessness I guess you could say). Sister hates dad, will respond to an occasional text message from him but really is not interested in maintaining any sort of relationship. Due to dad’s inability to speak on the phone or use internet, I drafted a Power of Attorney document online and had it notarized, so I now have POA for my father and can speak with the bank and other companies on his behalf.

This situation is brand new to us both, and we’re trying to figure out the smartest way to go about handling my parents’ house. House is on Long Island, NY, and still has a $60k home equity loan, and my dad’s only source of income is social security. We’ve gotten some minimal life insurance policies from my mom, but my sister and I are terrified he’s going to blow through that money if he lives for longer than 5 years, due to maintaining his drinking habit. Still, keeping him in the house seems to be the cheapest option, as we could not afford putting him in assisted living or anything.

My sister mentioned to me the other day that she thinks we need to start working on having our names added to the house, in the event that he passes. I’m not sure that would be the smartest thing to do here, and I’m not sure what makes this move better than ensuring that it’s indicated in his will that the house goes to us. My husband and I hope to buy our first home in the next two years, and I know my sister and her family will likely buy a new house in the next year or two. I’m worried that adding our name will attach the home equity loan to us in a negative way. My husband thinks adding our names to the house will negatively impact our credit, or impact our taxes, or cause issues for us in general.

Any suggestions on the best next step here? Is there a benefit to having our names on the house, versus just having it outlined in his will that the house would be left to us?

Additionally, any suggestions in general on how to be smart in dealing with estate matters would be so, SO appreciated. This has been such an unbelievably exhausting process as I knew nothing about any of this before she passed, and it feels like I’m stumbling my way through it all. Thank you for any insight!

I’m not sure that would be the smartest thing to do here, and I’m not sure what makes this move better than ensuring that it’s indicated in his will that the house goes to us. My husband and I hope to buy our first home in the next two years, and I know my sister and her family will likely buy a new house in the next year or two. I’m worried that adding our name will attach the home equity loan to us in a negative way. My husband thinks adding our names to the house will negatively impact our credit, or impact our taxes, or cause issues for us in general.

Any suggestions on the best next step here? Is there a benefit to having our names on the house, versus just having it outlined in his will that the house would be left to us?

Additionally, any suggestions in general on how to be smart in dealing with estate matters would be so, SO appreciated.

" Q: Should my dad’s house be put in my name, or gifted to me in the will?
T: BAD
B: New York - My mother passed away in January, and she handled nearly all of my parents’ finances. I’ve taken the lead in figuring out their financial situation, and my sister has been helpful when necessary. (Dad, 73, is a lifelong severe alcoholic, has a permanent tracheotomy so he is unable to speak, never learned how to use a computer so he is unable to do anything with internet, and in general seems to have some learned helplessness I guess you could say). Sister hates dad, will respond to an occasional text message from him but really is not interested in maintaining any sort of relationship. Due to dad’s inability to speak on the phone or use internet, I drafted a Power of Attorney document online and had it notarized, so I now have POA for my father and can speak with the bank and other companies on his behalf.

This situation is brand new to us both, and we’re trying to figure out the smartest way to go about handling my parents’ house. House is on Long Island, NY, and still has a $60k home equity loan, and my dad’s only source of income is social security. We’ve gotten some minimal life insurance policies from my mom, but my sister and I are terrified he’s going to blow through that money if he lives for longer than 5 years, due to maintaining his drinking habit. Still, keeping him in the house seems to be the cheapest option, as we could not afford putting him in assisted living or anything.

My sister mentioned to me the other day that she thinks we need to start working on having our names added to the house, in the event that he passes.

","I will start by clarifying that IANAL but I handled my parents estate. If the only thing your dad owns of value is the house, it can be handled in a few ways. Adding your names prior to his death has negative tax implications and it ties you to the debt on the property so I don't recommend it at all. It can/will hurt your credit or ability to get loans in the future because his house debt is now your house debt. Instead he can simply leave it to you and/or your sister in his will or you can file a transfer on death which means the minute he dies, the property transfers. This leads to the second piece of advice. Get a simple will drawn up. Most lawyers will do it for less than $500 and is important if he owns anything at all. Make a list of every possible asset he has and share that with the lawyer. 

Set up a medical power of attorney also. The POA you already set up doesn't cover medical. These are standard documents and can be downloaded from the internet, filled out, and signed. You can also get them from the hospital or your doctors office typically. 

If he has bank accounts, you can file papers with the bank that once he passes, they will transfer to you. Do not put your name on the accounts because it could tie you to his debt if he dies and is not financially on the positive side.

If he has a car, the DMV should have paperwork available to also have it transfer on death. Again, don't add your name to the title because then it is a liability to you. If he hits someone or something while driving, you are liable and it can also hurt your credit. 

Best of luck to you and if you have more questions, feel free to ask. END"
" Q: Wedding venue wants to keep $10,000 in deposits for cancelling due to COVID...
T: GOOD
B: Hi! My fiancé and I were supposed to be getting married at a wedding venue in Massachusetts. We had been making payments $17k so far) for quite some time. 

Massachusetts by order will not enter into phase 4 of lockdowns until a vaccine is up. So currently, weddings in Mass. can’t have dancing, open bar, shared food items including food stations, and only 25 people. 

Our wedding contract is for 110 - 125 people, with catering that includes multiple food stations, food sharing, dance floor for dancing, and a bunch of other things the venue can no longer do due to the government restrictions. 

So basically we can only have 25 people and not much of what we agreed to have. Also, and here’s the kicker, we now live in Florida and the governor has a non-enforced order for travelers to quarantine for 2 weeks...

The contract has a force majeure clause but the venue says it’s not something we can exercise because they can still technically give us a wedding But will need to modify what we agreed to.

Our argument is that given they can not fulfill well over 75% of the contract due to the pandemic (which the contract actually speaks to an epidemic/pandemic directly causing force majeure) that it should be void and our payments returned. We even said given the hit to their industry we may be open to negotiate (I wanted to offer 1 maybe $2,000 but haven’t yet) 

They basically said the contract is still enforced, they could technically charge us a penalty for cancelling meaning we’d owe them ANOTHER $8k on top of the $17k we’ve paid, but out of courtesy they’ll give us $7k back and we’d just be out $10k

Taking emotions out of it, this just seems wrong contractually and ethically.

But I am not a legal expert and am currently shopping around attorneys in case they won’t negotiate. So what do you think?

","Lawyer here, not in MA. 

My gut reaction is that the force majeure clause should be applicable here and their attempt to nullify it because they can give you something else is improper. You didn’t contract for a small wedding without the things that you would be losing. If you signed a contract to buy a Ferrari and it was lost or something the dealer couldn’t say “okay well take this mustang instead, it’s pretty fast.” You contracted for specific services, services they can no longer provide through no fault of either party. It sucks for everybody but that is why this clause is there. 

That being said, I do not know how these clauses are treated in MA but a lawyer in that jurisdiction will be able to help there. END"

","Call the police if you think the owner is dead.

Also, there is zero reason to think contacting the Coop’s attorney (the Proprietary Lessor is the Coop as per the unit owner’s Proprietary Lease) will somehow result in you having a below-market offer for the unit accepted. The Coop doesn’t own the unit because its owner died. The apartment belongs to the owner’s estate and will be sold as part of her estate proceedings (NYC will appoint an administrator to do this if she has no will). One of the only redeeming qualities of owning a Coop apartment is their price resiliency—even estate sales are subject to Board approval and the Board won’t hesitate to reject a sale that they think will drag down the comps in their building.

","Lawyer here, not in MS. 

Miss. Code 89-8-13 provides that you may seek to terminate the lease in the event of a material noncompliance with the lease agreement by the landlord. This states that you need to give 14 days written notice to the landlord describing the breach and that the lease will terminate not was than 14 days after the date of the notice if the breach is not remedied. If they do remedy it, the lease will not terminate. Given this isn’t a typical breach such as failure to repair or something like that, it isn’t clear if there is a way they could properly “remedy” this, aside from making you feel comfortable that it wouldn’t happen again. 

In the event they remedy it, 89-8-13(3)(b) states that if it happens again within 6 months, you can terminate wit 14 days notice regardless of their attempts to remedy. If the agreement is terminated, subsection (4) provides that the landlord shall return all prepaid and unearned rent as well as the security deposit recoverable by the tenant. 

So if you do want out, it may be worth consulting a lawyer as this is both a breach of the lease agreement and arguably the covenant of quiet enjoyment and there is no requirement in the statute that the landlord breach multiple times. The question will end up being whether it was a “material breach,” which a local lawyer will be able to provide more information about. END"

" Q: Guy on the next street landed his drone in my yard, my dog ruined it. He wants me to file a claim with my homeowner's insurance.
T: GOOD
B: Hi all, Iowa state question for you:

Last week someone who lives a street over from me was testing out his new drone. He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.

By this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog ""vicious"" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.

He came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.

This morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.

We are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because ""dog damaged property"" has a pretty nasty ring to it.  Thanks to the fact that the drone was literally carrying a camera we know our dog wasn't chewing on it or anything, but I don't want a record on our homeowner's insurance that implies we have a dangerous dog - hell maybe by insurance standards she IS dangerous for this, but I'm very leery of it.

Obviously I understand that if our dog bites someone on our property that is a problem and we are liable - but is there anything legal that dictates fault if someone lands a drone on our property? Not surprisingly Google is failing me here.  We are debating whether to try and come to an agreement with him or if we should tell him to kick rocks. Thank you.

","Commercial drone pilot here, I'd tell him to beat it. 

If you feel so inclined to give him an actual response, FAA guidelines for sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft Systems) are pretty strict on what you can and can't do...

First step is to inquire if his drone is registered with the FAA. 

Then check to see if he broke any of these guidelines:
 - are you within 5 miles of an airport? Did he receive permission from the airport to fly?
 - did he fly over any people or moving vehicles?
 - did he fly beyond his visual line of sight of the drone? (Not knowing if the camera was attached would indicate yes)
 - was he flying at night? 
 - was he operating commercially? If yes, does he have a Part 107?
 - finally, was he operating in a ""careless or reckless manner?""

If any of these were even slightly amiss, you can threaten call the local FAA Flight Standards District Office, and they can handle a legit aircraft complaint. 

As someone who has operated drones commercially with many hours of flight time, he is completely in the wrong. He didn't properly secure the landing site, which is entirely on him as the pilot. Your dog was confined to your property, in a safe manner with proper protections in place. 

This is like me jumping your fence to rob you, and then complaining when the dog bites me. If it gets as far as a civil suit, any decent judge will throw that out in a heartbeat.


EDIT: just scrolled up and read the part about ""BUSINESS insurance""... If this happened while the guy was operating commercially, then PLEASE report it to the FAA. Your local FSDO can roast this guy alive. Those guidelines I mentioned turn into hard rules you must follow, or lose your flying privileges. 

Also... Jokes on him for using commercial insurance and not getting the drone covered. (free advice here folks, if you're gonna fly professionally, get the insurance. I've got $5 million on my fleet.) END"

" Q: Guy on the next street landed his drone in my yard, my dog ruined it. He wants me to file a claim with my homeowner's insurance.
T: BAD
B: Hi all, Iowa state question for you:

Last week someone who lives a street over from me was testing out his new drone. He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.

By this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog ""vicious"" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.

He came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.

This morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.

We are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because ""dog damaged property"" has a pretty nasty ring to it.  Thanks to the fact that the drone was literally carrying a camera we know our dog wasn't chewing on it or anything, but I don't want a record on our homeowner's insurance that implies we have a dangerous dog - hell maybe by insurance standards she IS dangerous for this, but I'm very leery of it.

","&gt;stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.

How much does he claim the drone is worth? If I were you, I'd notify your insurer of the incident, because just in case you somehow lose in court, you may want them to pay the claim. 

If he files a small claims lawsuit (he may just be bluffing), go into small claims court and tell the judge this idiot landed his creepy peeping Tom drone on your property ten feet from your dog.  You should win, but there are no guarantees in small claims court. END"

If you don't pay as agreed, then yes, they can put a lien on the property.    If you agreed to pay after the work was done, then show them that contract.

In many situations, the contractor needs your downpayment to purchase the materials and pay his workers, so its common to ask for 1/3 before they start, 1/3 in the middle, and 1/3 when done.    or 1/2 upfront and 1/2 when done.   Else, where does he get the money to purchase the asphalt? END"

" Q: HOA and interpretation of Covenant
T: GOOD
B: I live on a corner lot and have submitted plans to build a fence. The covenant language states that “No fence or structure shall be erected or altered so that any portion thereof extends in front of the building line of the rear of the dwelling house”.  HOA President is claiming that since I’m on a corner lot, I have two rear lines (essentially limiting my fence-able area to a corner of my yard farthest away from both streets).  I found that the county code does not follow this definition of the corner lot.  According to the zoning code, I have one rear line and that line coincides with the area across the back of my house where I wanted to install my fence.  I pointed this out to the HOA and was told that he covenant is what matters, not county code.

But the covenant does not define what it means by building line of the rear of the house...which is why I went to the zoning code to get a legal definition. Further, following his interpretation means literally no structures (including patios, decks, etc.) can be erected in the back yards of corner lots. That’s absurd and clearly not the intent of the covenant—every corner lot in the neighborhood has some such structure in that area.

Can the HOA use discretion in this case? I feel like the President doesn’t like the idea of the fence (or being challenged) but I don’t see how it violates the covenant at all...

" Q: Leasing office fumbled leaseholder paperwork
T: GOOD
B: Location: Jersey City, NJ 

Summary: Leasing office did not process paperwork correctly, leaving me as the sole leaseholder and accountable party of a 3BR apartment. Roommate has taken advantage of the legal situation and left the apartment without finding a replacement, leaving us to compensate for his rent.

In March 2019, my two roommates (A and B) and I signed a lease renewal for our 3BR apartment. A and B joined mid-lease 2019, and were only occupants at this time, not leaseholders. I was the only leaseholder at this time because I was there during the signing of the original lease in 2018. Both roommates were aligned with the lease renewal and expressed long term interest in the apartment. This was right before the virus began to gain speed.

We wanted to add them as leaseholders before signing the renewal but could not, as the office said that the previous roommates had to be removed from the lease, before adding A and B. After accepting this, I signed and we left that meeting, and contacted my previous roommates. We learned the previous roommates had submitted their lease removal forms last year and it was already processed. I was already the only leaseholder during the time of this signing, and we could have added A and B during the resigning meeting.

To formalize A and B as leaseholders, we prepared the necessary forms ASAP. However, the office was already closed and we could not submit the forms in-person. We called the office and were instructed to send the representative the forms via email instead. We emailed the forms to the office on the same day. We followed up multiple times with no confirmation that A and B were added to the lease.

We would not have signed the lease renewal, if we knew that A and B would not be added to the lease. It's a professional courtesy and expectation of the leasing office to acknowledge our application -- either by accepting, or explaining what was missing, which we were willing to immediately address.

Because B was not added to the lease, he has now taken advantage of the situation. He moved out of the apartment last week without any contractual obligation to pay, and we are forced to compensate for his rent. His room was around 40% of the total rent, and A and I must now pay that, in addition to our current rent. We cannot find a replacement roommate in the current environment, even when offering discounted rates. B refuses to help pay for any months until a replacement is found, or any early lease termination fee, because he was not formally on the lease.

Now that we are working remote, A and I are both living at our parents houses. We don't necessarily need the apartment for the foreseeable future, so we are *okay* with a full lease termination.

I asked about lease termination options in June when B first told us his move out plans, and learned I am expected to pay 3 months worth of rent ($12k+ between A and myself) to terminate the lease. This is unreasonable because of the steps my roommates and I took to explicitly avoid this situation.

I sent an email explaining the situation to the leasing office and the representative two days ago after realizing that we had evidence of their negligence, but they haven't responded.

I've laid out what seems to be the available options.

* Option 1: Leasing office recognizes their fault and gives us some compensation in the form of early lease termination with waived fee, or rent reduction to exclude the third room.
* Option 2: There is some sort of legal action we can take to be compensated for the leasing office's mistakes
* Option 3: A and I terminate the lease by the office's terms by paying 3 months worth of rent
* Option 4: A and I keep paying inflated rent and looking for a replacement. This is the least desirable route because we don't need an apartment, and it is very difficult to find a roommate.

**What action can I take if they choose not to respond?** I don't have much experience in this area, but  we do have records of our emails and any lack of follow up from the office. Thanks for any help.

###

","No, the whole point of the contract is that it writes out what each party is agreeing to. There is a doctrine of scrivener's error (when there is some error in the written contract and there is clear evidence that it does not match what both parties agreed to orally). But it sounds the OP and the landlord agreed on a renewal with only the OP on the lease, with a separate understanding that the lease could be modified in the future to include the other roommates. The fact is that A and B signed no contract with anyone. If A and B's names were not on the lease it's basically impossible for OP to say that he thought he was signing a document with A and B's names on it. OP should not have signed the lease until the issue was resolved. 

It's also probably a moot point, because rental agreements like this almost always state joint and several liability meaning the landlord can go after the roommates as a group or each individual roommate for the full amount. So even if B had signed, the landlord can ask OP for the full amount. OP and B have no actual contractual obligation to each other. To protect themselves, OP, A and B should have asked for separate leases, or they should have made a contract with each other regarding who was responsible for the full amount. END"

His room was around 40% of the total rent, and A and I must now pay that, in addition to our current rent. We cannot find a replacement roommate in the current environment, even when offering discounted rates. B refuses to help pay for any months until a replacement is found, or any early lease termination fee, because he was not formally on the lease.

Now that we are working remote, A and I are both living at our parents houses. We don't necessarily need the apartment for the foreseeable future, so we are *okay* with a full lease termination.

I asked about lease termination options in June when B first told us his move out plans, and learned I am expected to pay 3 months worth of rent ($12k+ between A and myself) to terminate the lease. This is unreasonable because of the steps my roommates and I took to explicitly avoid this situation.

I sent an email explaining the situation to the leasing office and the representative two days ago after realizing that we had evidence of their negligence, but they haven't responded.

I've laid out what seems to be the available options.

* Option 1: Leasing office recognizes their fault and gives us some compensation in the form of early lease termination with waived fee, or rent reduction to exclude the third room.
* Option 2: There is some sort of legal action we can take to be compensated for the leasing office's mistakes
* Option 3: A and I terminate the lease by the office's terms by paying 3 months worth of rent
* Option 4: A and I keep paying inflated rent and looking for a replacement. This is the least desirable route because we don't need an apartment, and it is very difficult to find a roommate.

**What action can I take if they choose not to respond?** I don't have much experience in this area, but  we do have records of our emails and any lack of follow up from the office. Thanks for any help.

","I know he can't say that he thought he was signing a lease with A and B on it. What was in question was whether he thought he was signing a lease with his old roommates on it, let's call them X and Y. Probably doesn't make a difference to the outcome if you're correct that it's joint and severable, but what the leasing office did seems very shady. They kept A and B off the lease because X and Y were supposedly already on the lease with OP. To say that A and B can't sign the new lease because X and Y are current leaseholders implies that the leasing office is saying OP isn't the only one on the hook.

Leasing office lied to him saying he had a lease with X and Y, then stonewalled him when he found out the truth and tried to add A and B. END"

" Q: Landlord's Worker Dropped a Fridge on my Car and Refuses to Pay the Damages
T: GOOD
B: I work an IT job for the school I go to that allows me to work from home right now. On June 24th, I was working from my living room when I saw two of my landlords workers carrying a fridge up the stairs. About 5 minutes later, they were coming back down the stairs with a different fridge. As they got to the landing of the stairs, the head worker handed the fridge off to his coworker for him to go put elsewhere.

My car was parked in the first parking spot closing to my apartment, it was directly in front of my living room and therefore in my line of sight.  This parking spot also was the closest spot to the stairway, where this lone worker was dollying a fridge through.

The worker had attempted to take the fridge off the curb right next to my car, which resulted in it toppling over and leaving a nasty scrape next to my car.

The next day I sent a picture to my landlord explaining what had happened. They replied, ""Get me 3 estimates for your car and get them to me. I am so sorry about that!"" So I broke quarantine and went and got the three estimates. After sending them to her it seems that she has no interest in paying the price of even the lowest estimate, which is around $835. She has pressured me into, 'taking it to a shop of her choice"" or to pay the amount of $300. I have declined both of these offers numerous times but she continues to come back to me repeating her offer.

Since I am a broke college student I am worried about getting a lawyer due to legal fees, which I am sure she knows and is playing off of.

What should I do?

","What state are you in?  You need to send your landlord a ""demand letter"" (look up that term) demanding that she pay you the damage of $835.  Send it certified, with receipt of delivery.  

In the demand letter, outline the case and state the fact. Note that they apologized for the damage and texted for you to get three estimates.  You get three estimates in good faith, and now they are declining to honor their obligation.  Demand that they reimburse you for damages of $835 within X days or you will seek legal recourse, including but not limited to damages, legal fees, and any other legal remedies possibly including but not limited to lost work, punitive damages, etc.

The last few of those are bullshit but sometimes enough to scare people.  Look up ""small claims court"" for the state in which you reside.  You don't have to pay for a lawyer.  All you have to do is pay the small claims court fee and fee to serve them with court, and bring your proof to the court.  Although you have no guarantee of winning, it appears to be a fairly simple case. END"

There is, however, a patchwork of protection provisions for whistleblowers under the Canadian Criminal Code, Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (PSDPA), the Public Service of Ontario Act, 2006 as well as the Securities Act.
Section 425.1 of the Criminal Code, for example, states that employers may not threaten or take disciplinary action against, demote or terminate an employee in order to deter him or her from reporting information regarding an offence he or she believes has or is being committed by his or her employer to the relevant law enforcement authorities.
In short, an employer cannot threaten an employee with negative repercussions to deter them from contacting law enforcement with information about their employer’s offence. Punishment for employers who make such threats or reprisals can include up to five years imprisonment and/or fines.

" Q: Alberta: Employer trying to control what I do outside of work
T: GOOD
B: My employer has made a policy that specifies things I must do while not at work (for example, at the grocery store, at the gas station, in any public space) at all times. This includes evenings and weekends. This policy was declared a condition of employment. When I said an employer is not allowed to dictate employees time away from work I was asked for my resignation if I wasn't going to comply.

Is my employer allowed to control my off hours? It seems like a basic principal, but can someone point me to somewhere in the [EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS CODE](https://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/E09.pdf) or some similar law? If I refuse to resign and am fired, would it be with cause?

I am an engineer, so some of the overtime rules don't apply. I usually work a standard 40 hour week during standard office hours unless overtime is needed.

The policy is about COVID precautions, the most silly of which was having to carry paper towel everywhere I go to use as a barrier when touching anything in public. I then have to dispose of it immediately, which usually involves dropping it on the ground. You can follow my boss around the building by the litter he leaves behind. I was given a tool kit of face mask, hand sanitizer, wet wipes, and paper towel that I am expected to carry around anytime I leave my house. I already wear a face mask in public and use the hand sanitizer available when entering stores.

###

","Ok, so I skimmed through the document  (it's 108 pages and it's 11:30 at night here) and as far as I can tell there is nothing saying you have to follow your boss' orders outside of work.  There are limits on what your boss can make you do and unless he's paying you for the time and resources to do it you are under no obligation to do it and that is covered in the document.  So he can ASK you to be extra careful so as to not catch the virus, but cannot make how you act outside of work a term of employment - unless you are deliberately putting others in danger.

Also point out to you boss that if he's dropping bit's of paper towel all over the place, then he's the one most likely to spread the virus since someone has to pick those bits of paper up.  It would be better to carry hand sanitiser with him, wear a face mask or wear gloves since paper towel will not protect you from the virus. END"

T: GOOD
B: I live in a town house with a terrible parking situation in Asheville NC, and I just got a letter telling me that they are redoing the side walks in 4 days. The letter stated as follows.

PLEASE BE ADVISED that you will NOT be able to exit or enter your home from 8 am to 6 pm Monday, Tuesday, Wed, and potentially thru Friday should there be inclement weather.  PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WE KNOW THIS IS AN INCONVENIENCE, however we believe the end result will be more than worth it.
Monday the 27th by 8 am please move your car from your area’s parking lot. This does include your assigned space. The entire area for your building must remain clear during the work.
 If you fail to remove your car from your parking lot by 8 am Monday the 27th YOUR CAR WILL BE TOWED AT YOUR EXPENSE.   
You are welcome to use the overflow lot and the top of the property and the RIGHT side of the main road that runs through the property. Please also remember that there may be 24 hour spaces in other cul de sacs that are not being worked on. So long as the space does not have a number and letter, it is a 24 hour space to all residents. We will allow curb parking and parking in front of the mailboxes for this week of work. We do NOT own the no parking area in front of Willow Ridge on Chunns Cove and if you park there, we cannot speak for if the city will tow your car or not. PLEASE BE COURTEOUS WHEN PARKING IN THE MAIN ROAD as this is impacting everyone and we all need to do what we can to make room for our neighbors. To be clear, your car must remain REMOVED from the area Mon-Wed, potentially thru Friday should we experience a set back.

" Q: (MA) Landlord claims a ""Letter of Intent to Renew"" is legally binding for the full year, even though we haven't signed next year's lease.
T: GOOD
B: Our current lease (September 2019-2020) has a clause in it that requires tenants to give 120 day notice of renewal or non-renewal. In May 2020, we received their letter of intent to renew that detailed the increase in rent and no other changes. At the time, we wanted to renew, so we signed this letter of intent. However, we recently received the new lease for September 2020-2021, and it contains new Landlord provisions that feel predatory and that we do not feel comfortable with.

We asked the landlords to change the provisions, they declined, so we let them know we will not be signing this new lease and will not be tenants for this upcoming year. They are now coming back and claiming that our letter of intent to renew is legally binding for the next year and we will be responsible for the whole next year of rent until they find new renters.

Is a letter of intent legally binding even if they change the terms of the agreement FAR after the fact? Our argument is that had we known of these lease changes at the time of renewal, we would have been able to give ample notice of non-renewal.

What are my options in terms of making sure we're not liable and that they won't keep our security deposit?

###

","What does the letter of intent say?  Normally, it will say something like ""on substantially the following terms.""

It can be legally binding, but the terms have to be sufficiently definite for both parties to be able to know what their obligations are.  Otherwise, it's just an ""agreement to agree,"" which is not enforceable.  If the Landlord has the ability to change significant terms of the underlying lease, then that letter of intent is probably not enforceable. END"

",The only other thing I would caution is that a letter of intent is supposed to show good faith negotiations. If you sign the letter of intent knowing you won’t renew no matter what terms are in the new contract then you might be on the hook for damages the landlord sustains from relying on you. However that would be very difficult for the landlord to prove. They would need to prove you had no intent and deceived them. At the end of the day courts just want parties to be fair to each other.

" Q: Close on home today. This massive hole was hidden by TV during walk through
T: GOOD
B: I closed on a home this morning and when I came in, the first thing I seen is this massive 2 foot by 3 foot hole above the fireplace. This was hidden by the TV the sellers had left up when I did the walk through the evening before. 

Below is a response from the seller when I told my realtor I expect them to fix it. 

""They are not agreeing to come fix that hole. They said that because you did a final walk-through and failed to look behind the TV, that is on you to fix. Legally, they are right. Closing signifies acceptance of the property in its current condition. And honestly, because you did a final walk-through, you have no legal ground to stand on, unfortunately. I’m so sorry. They said they were not hiding the hole. They were just waiting to pack the TV last into their car because it was fragile. That space was designed to put a TV up there so they assumed it was no big deal. It was like that when they bought it."" 

I feel they were hiding it purposely and waiting to pack the TV is a lie because they had no less than five other TVs in the home that were all taken down and packed away. It seems to me by leaving the TV up and none of the others, that shows an intent to deceive and hide massive damage. 

This is in North Carolina and before anyone asks, I'm not hanging a TV above the fireplace because I hate that for several reasons.

A 2 foot hole in the wall is ridiculous to go undisclosed. Tell them that you would like them to fix or compensate for it's repair.

B: Long story short. I have an ex that will not leave me alone and has went out of her way to lie about me and tell people that I harass her and won't leave her alone. We split up over six months ago. About three weeks ago I got a letter in the mail from a detective that said that I have been under investigation for months because of some allegations that have been made against me. The letter also said that if I do not call to schedule an appointment for questioning by a certain date that they'll ""Consider it that I'm not willing to assist a criminal investigation."" So I called in and asked what it was about and the detective told me that she works for some special victims unit and it has to do with my ex and something about harassment. She said that she is just doing a follow up investigation on a criminal complaint. But wouldn't say anything else about it. 

How should I take this? Anyone else ever dealt with anything like this? 
Should I have a lawyer? 
And do I even legally have to go in for questioning? Can they issue a warrant over me not going in? 

I have work and can't afford to miss and it seems like it's just more shit that my ex made up.

" Q: Police asked me to come in for questioning, what should I do?
T: BAD
B: Long story short. I have an ex that will not leave me alone and has went out of her way to lie about me and tell people that I harass her and won't leave her alone. We split up over six months ago. About three weeks ago I got a letter in the mail from a detective that said that I have been under investigation for months because of some allegations that have been made against me. The letter also said that if I do not call to schedule an appointment for questioning by a certain date that they'll ""Consider it that I'm not willing to assist a criminal investigation."" So I called in and asked what it was about and the detective told me that she works for some special victims unit and it has to do with my ex and something about harassment. She said that she is just doing a follow up investigation on a criminal complaint. But wouldn't say anything else about it. 

How should I take this? Anyone else ever dealt with anything like this? 
Should I have a lawyer? 
And do I even legally have to go in for questioning? Can they issue a warrant over me not going in?

This continues every couple years reaching out saying he needs to be apart of the kids life, he asks for proof, she refuses and he stops talking to her.

It has been 7 years and she still refuses to get the test for proof.  At this point it feel like she is stalking him. And without proof he is not going to reach out a be some kids dad.

","NAL.  Someone who is serious about compelling their child’s father to either a) pay child support or b) be involved will go to court to get an order for a paternity test.  There may be a reason she doesn’t want such a test.

You do not need a paternity test to establish a harassment order.  Many counties have a fairly straightforward “self help” process (easy forms) to initiate the harassment order process.

Of course, a harassment order would not prevent the ex from getting a court order for a paternity test (which it sounds like you would obviously comply with).  However, based on the above, there may be a reason she doesn’t want a paternity test.

EDIT:  If you want to definitively know, you can initiate the petition to establish paternity.  You may want to be involved in the chance it IS his child. END"

" Q: HOA vs. Neighborhood Association (MI)
T: GOOD
B: I live in Michigan. I recently received a visit from the president of our neighborhood group about my yard. We have a couple signs up, which are apparently not allowed under the rules. He told me he had received a complaint. We had also been looking into building a fence soon, which he said is also against the rules. This visit is the first step in rule enforcement.

Here's the thing: A number of people in our neighborhood insist that we have a neighborhood association and not an HOA, and thus it is voluntary and they have no power to enforce the rules (including someone on the board). They say only one new phase of our neighborhood has an HOA and it is a completely different organization because it is only now being built 60 years later (that is another story). I asked the president whether our organization was voluntary or not, he gave me a non-answer. I asked him what the penalties were if we failed to comply and he said they could not put a lien on the house, but the next step if we didn't resolve it would be to get lawyers involved. I know that at least 1/3 of the residents don't pay dues, many people of signs (political or otherwise) and there are other rule violations all over (e.g., storing boats or trailers).

When we moved in, we were told by the previous owners that this was an HOA and we signed something as part of our closing saying it was mandatory with annual dues, which we paid last year under that impression. This paper was not from the association, it was from the sellers as a disclosure. Those folks didn't live here long so I would not be surprised if they were misled.

My questions:

1. How can I be sure whether this is an HOA or a voluntary neighborhood association?
2. If it is voluntary, did the ""mandatory"" paper or paying dues lock us in forever somehow?
3. If it is voluntary, am I within my rights to ignore the rules?
4. Does the selective enforcement matter? I doubt we're being discriminated against in any illegal way, I think we just have a neighbor that dislikes us that complained.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add info:

At this point, I doubt anyone will see these edits, but I did some digging. In MI, HOAs have to file with the state and file annual reports. The earliest available was 2007, in which the organization described itself as a neighborhood association. In 2009, it began referring to itself as a homeowner's association. I contacted the county and there are no deed restrictions related to an HOA, just public utility easements. At this point I am worried that the seller's addendum could lock us in somehow to this seemingly non-HOA that presents itself as an HOA.

###

","1. If it is a HOA it must have written bylaws which will detail an annual meeting, how board members are chosen, your appeal process, etc. Lack of that you don't have one.

2. If it is voluntary, I would assume it is just that, voluntary, but I have no experience in this particular question.

3. I would think you could just ignore it

4. Selective enforcement matters a lot. We had this issue in an HOA i was a resident of in Michigan. The previous board had ignored most of the bylaws. When the new board tried to enforce rules, many residents threatened to sue. The HOA hired an attorney who advised us we needed to ""grandfather"" in anyone who was allowed rule infractions without consequence or any future attempts to enforce would be thrown out.

I have served on HOA boards and was a past president of the neighborhood HOA I lived in. The rules are very specific in Michigan and the boards cannot run their own little kingdoms. I would demand, in writing, a copy of the bylaws. If they don't exist, I would ask where they believe they receive their authority. I can't imagine a situation where your town or county would support any enforcement without bylaws in place. There must be a written process that is ALWAYS followed for rule infractions, otherwise they have no legal standing to enforce against you. As a side note, in an actual HOA, at closing you sign a form that says you have received the bylaws and agree to their contents. Without that i am not sure how you could have a legal and enforceable HOA.

I am not an attorney, but play one on the internet. Seriously though I do have a number of years experience living in HOAs and serving on their boards.

Hope that is helpful END"

Those rules will spell out the conditions upon which you can be elected, and there are probably requirements and restrictions like term limits, the existence of a quorum, etc.  Verify this person is who he says he is.

Also, its a good idea to go to your HOA meetings fairly frequently.  Helping keep your HOA on the right track pays off in the long run, and you end up knowing who's who. END"
" Q: Is my wife getting ripped off?
T: GOOD
B: My wife has worked in a full time position for the same engineering company for 10 years. In the last year we welcomed our second child into the world and she took 6 months maternity leave. 
She returned to work yesterday to begin her temporary hours, 6 months of work in a part time capacity( 3 days a week).
She was informed on her first day that half of her responsibilities have been given to other employees and that after the next 6 months her part time hours will become her new permanent position.
She has a signed agreement from them that she would return to her full time position after the 6 months. 
Is she entitled to a redundancy package from her full time position?
Her part time offer is basically a new job she will hate.

","Federal labor law has often upheld that an employee just being required to carry as pager or cell phone while on call are not neccesarily engaged to wait, so long as they are not required to remain at or near the workplace.

Unfortunately, it sounds like OP would more likely fall under this category, because they can still use the time spend on call productively for their own purposes (housework, spending time with family, ect.). It's not something I agree with and it's unfair to workers, especially when they're put in a position where they are never really free to enjoy their time off, but it's the decision federal court has upheld.

https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/cms_020208.aspx

Generally, it seems like the biggest difference between engaged to wait and waiting to be engaged are whether you're required to remain within a certain proximity of the job site.

Edit: However, OP may still qualify as engaged to wait depending on the frequency and amount of phone calls they are answering.  For example, if they only have half an hour to an hour between phone calls, they could make an argument that that they are not free to enjoy that time and are engaged to wait.  On the other hand, if they only typically receive one phone call a night, the rest of their time could be waiting to be engaged.  I doubt that just having to check the phone once an hour would be considered interrupting enough for this to be engaged to wait. END"

I posted about what happened on Sunday on here and got some great advice. 

Here is a link to my earlier post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/hubyrc/co_landlord_allowed_stranger_into_apartment

The gist is that the apartment released my friend's apartment key to a complete stranger. This stranger let himself into her apartment and was rummaging around when my friend woke up and saw him. She wasn't dressed when she noticed him and when he saw her he began to demand that she explain what she was doing in her own home. 

JJ is talking with the apartment complex staff, and has sent emails requesting the name of the person who was let into her apartment but the landlord is refusing to give her that information. 

Is there anything she can do to make them tell her who was let into her home? We have read the lease together and the actions of the apartment agency clearly violates the clause of the lease that governs when people may be allowed into the apartment.

Also, she hasn't been able to sleep in the apartment and is thinking about moving somewhere else. She only just renewed her lease in March and wasn't planning on moving till next June. 

Is there any way her apartment can be made to pay for the cost of her moving? Can she take them to small claims court to get them to pay for her move? 

Thanks

","This might be a bit of a stretch, but I'd try it if I were her: Talk to an attorney about constructive eviction/breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Landlords have an obligation to maintain the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and if they don't respond to her good-faith efforts to do things like get a deadbolt installed and change her locks, or to update their security standards, she might have a case?

I'd also advise her to speak to a therapist. Both because it sounds like she went through something scary and traumatic, and also because it might be good for future legal cases if she has a medical professional document that she's since had trouble sleeping and feeling secure in her own home.

NAL, but best of luck to your friend. END"

B: My local public school district has decided to go with remote learning, but the private school I work at has decided to open fully in-person. They want me to sign a waiver releasing them ""from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, rights, damages, expenses, and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, and other losses of any kind, whether known or unknown"" arising from Covid-19 during my employment. The waiver also states that ""I understand and acknowledge that the Colorado Workers’ Compensation Act is my exclusive remedy against the School and the School Group for any and all work-related injuries, including illnesses."" A little bit of Googling seems to show me that the Colorado Workers' Compensation Act is currently only giving coronavirus protection to essential workers, which teachers are NOT considered.

My school is tiny and has less than dozen teachers. I've organized for all of us to talk about this together before signing. What should our next steps and our demands be?

Edit: I'm at a small private school so we don't have a union. We are looking to consult a lawyer so that we can further understand the waiver, what access we will have to Workers' Comp claims if we get sick, and if we are covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. If anyone can help with further information on those things, that would be fantastic. From there we will be preparing a list of demands. Unfortunately, it turns out that some of the teachers at my school have already signed the waiver (!?!), but I am encouraging the rest not to sign.

","Honestly, with a group that unified, you make the rules. I would be gunning for unlimited sick time off, some amount of paid sick time off higher than what you currently have, and possibly to be provided with masks, face shields, and sanitization. Also, of course, preventing symptomatic students from coming to class and requiring all students to wear masks. These are basic demands that should be any teacher’s standard for returning to class. Pro-tip for making demands of an institution: include EVERYTHING you could possibly want, as so to make the more reasonable things (like sick time off and mask requirements) a low hanging fruit for them. They’ll feel like they got out of having to give you double pay, and you’ll have gotten everything you actually wanted (and maybe more!). 

What they’re asking for isn’t necessarily unreasonable: they just don’t want you to sue them if you get covid-19 and get really sick/end up with medical debt. That would be pretty hard anyways because you would have to prove you got sick because of the school. But you should also expect them to make reasonable accommodations to prevent such things from happening, like providing and requiring masks (although legally I’m not sure that they have to do anything: check indoor covid requirements in CO for a better idea). If they really want you to sign, they’ll meet your guidelines for what safety looks like. Good luck and best wishes: my parents are teachers and I’m keeping y’all in my heart this fall ❤️ END"

Last week, by text, she made the claim that there was no will and has not responded to any of our messages since. We are all very skeptical about this claim and are worried that she may be hiding the will against our father’s last wishes. We are suspicious for a few reasons:

1. He called my sister in 2018 stating that he was making her co-executor of his will and that he wanted to leave money for us.

2. He was a very organized and intelligent man, so the idea of him not organizing a will at any point either before or after his second marriage is shocking.

The problem is that we do not have the name of his attorney or a copy of the will. We also do not know if a will was filed with his death certificate, or if this lawyer was notified about his death. 

Ultimately we are wondering if this case is worth pursuing legally, and if there is a way to locate his lawyer without having to contact our stepmother?

","If he told her he was moving it to her account for safekeeping it does not sound like he told her it was a gift. And it's not a gift causa mortis for the same reason/ in addition, most state statutes defining a gift causa mortis require death to be an external event. Georgia says, ""must be in his last illness or in peril of death;"". So it's debatable whether such a transfer would be upheld as a gift.

" Q: Landlord evicting me for staying somewhere else after roofers dropped an AC through my roof
T: GOOD
B: This post is on behalf of my sister, who finds herself going through a rough time right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a sober living complex in SLC, UT. This has been where I have lived for the past 2 years while going through drug court and remaining sober. I do not know if this being a sober living community has any bearing on the legality of the situation, but it is an apartment building with about 20 units.

During the beginning of COVID, we were asked to self isolate, not have any guests, and refrain from traveling. We never signed any sort of addendum about this. It is not in the lease.

4 days ago, a construction crew dropped an air conditioning unit through the roof into my apartment, leaving a gaping hole in the roof. I decided to spend 2 nights elsewhere while they figured out how to repair the roof. 

My landlord discovered this after they let themselves into my apartment (which is fine, this constitutes an emergency), and confronted me about my absence on day 3 after the roof situation. My landlord stated that because I had decided to stay somewhere else, I had broken the rules and had to leave immediately. I returned to my apartment, where they escorted me upstairs (they had already changed the locks), gave me black garbage bags, and forced me to grab as many things as I could, and then I was escorted off the property. Some of my items are still in the apartment, such as clothes, shoes, pictures, food, etc. My daughter's belongings are also still in the apartment. I could find nowhere to stay that night, and so I slept in a Uhaul truck last night while my daughter slept at a friends. My locks are still changed and I am unable to enter the apartment.

It's important to note that I was not served any type of notice to vacate. I was told to call my landlord on day 3 after the roof was damaged, where they told me I had to come back immediately, pack my things, and leave. This was all over the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Because this is a sober living facility, do they have any special ability to evict someone for not self isolating due to COVID? I'm current on rent and have not broken my lease agreement.
2. Do they still have to follow standard eviction process of serving notice, then filing in court?
3. Can I get the police to let me back into my apartment, and is this considered an illegal eviction?
4. Does Utah still have a stay on evictions right now?

T: GOOD
B: Hi all, so my fiancés stepbrother, SB from now on, and SB's GF, just GF from now on, have a daughter. She's 11 months old and the family is starting to get worried.
Brief background, GF was 14 and SB was 17 when they started having sex. Yes it was skeevy but there's a law in NC called Romeo and Juliet that protects couples who went to high school together. Anyway, they had unprotected sex for 2 years and got lucky, I guess.. until they didn't.
She was 16 when she announced she was pregnant.. gleefully. SB was... dead silent. Never talked about it, barely responded to the obligatory congratulations being offered through clenched teeth.
Everyone who had spent more than an hour with them knew they weren't ready.
SB did not want this kid.
SB stated he did not want this kid.
As time has gone on, more and more shit has piled up, its easier to bullet point.
1. SB smokes weed and vapes around their daughter constantly

","Yes, I think this warrants calling CPS.

It's difficult to say what CPS will do.  If they feel the child is in immediate danger, they will likely remove her.  Usually, they try to place children with family first.  I'm not sure what you consider a ""slap on the wrist"" to be.  CPS is mostly interested in getting the situation fixed so that the children can stay with their parents.  They will most likely work on remediating the issues before permanently removing the daughter. END"

B: Hi all, so my fiancés stepbrother, SB from now on, and SB's GF, just GF from now on, have a daughter. She's 11 months old and the family is starting to get worried.
Brief background, GF was 14 and SB was 17 when they started having sex. Yes it was skeevy but there's a law in NC called Romeo and Juliet that protects couples who went to high school together. Anyway, they had unprotected sex for 2 years and got lucky, I guess.. until they didn't.
She was 16 when she announced she was pregnant.. gleefully. SB was... dead silent. Never talked about it, barely responded to the obligatory congratulations being offered through clenched teeth.
Everyone who had spent more than an hour with them knew they weren't ready.
SB did not want this kid.

","If you ever question ""should I call CPS about this,"" the answer is yes, just to be safe. If CPS doesn't think what you have reported warrants further than the mandatory investigation, they'll close the case, no harm, no fowl. However, if something seriously is wrong, you could literally save this child's life. I recently watched a local trial where a young girl died from neglect- exposure, starvation, and dehydration END"

" Q: My (US) bank gave me Canadian money, and won't take it back.
T: GOOD
B: It's as weird as it sounds. I live in a building with coin operated laundry, so I've been having a tough time getting laundry done lately with the US coin shortage. On Monday I gave it another go, and stood in line at the bank for about an hour. They told me there was a one-per-customer limit on the quarter rolls, so I gave them my $10 bill and went home with a roll. After struggling trying to get the washing machine to accept the quarters - I realized more than half of them were Canadian coins! For anyone who doesn't know, the Canadian 25 cent coins are the same color, size and shape as American quarters, but coin machines won't take them.

I went back to the bank, waited in line again, and explained my situation to the teller - who told me that there was ""no proof"" I had purchased the coins from the bank (to be fair I definitely didn't ask for a receipt for purchasing a roll of quarters), and said they weren't allowed to give me replacement quarters. I paid in cash so there's no record of the purchase on my bank card.

I realize there probably is no available course of action outside of complaining about it to the bank; I'm just upset I basically threw my money away (and still can't do laundry lol). Any ideas?

###

","They can't give you replacement quarters (even if you did use your debit card), but you can do a currency exchange. It's a long transaction and, with the exchange rate, you'll only get back 19 cents (as of today) per Canadian quarter, BUT you'll get money back AND make the teller go through a long, PITA transaction for an absolutely petty amount of money.

Before you do that, I would also see if you can speak with the branch manager about the issue, but frame it in a ""this is just so weird, but you may want to give the central vault a head's up that their coin machine is not catching Canadian quarters"" way. They may just make it right for you. If they don't, then file the formal complaint and do the currency exchange.

Having worked as a bank teller, I can think of 2 ways this would have happened.

* Less likely: the central vault for your bank in your area let the CA quarters slip through
* More likely: another bank customer rolled their coins at home (either not catching the foreign coins or putting them in deliberately) and deposited them. With the coin shortage, the branch is not able to send as many coins as they normally would, so when this person deposited coins, they were immediately used by the tellers without sending to the vault first for verification. This is against protocol, but when there is a shortage, the branch will use whatever it can to get through the day.

\*Edit: foreign currency exchange is highly bank specific. Some have minimum amounts, some will not accept coins, some have certain branches that are handle foreign currency,, and some don't deal with it at all. Check with your bank to see if they will exchange foreign coins for US dollars. END"
" Q: [SF,CA] Abusive Landlord demanding over $14k after move-out for fancy upgrades
T: GOOD
B: I'm sick to my stomach. My landlord has been a nightmare for 7+ years. I finally thought I was free of him after moving out, and now he's found a way to be a jerk even after I've moved states.

Before I get to the charges (which I think are all bogus), I have a few issues with timing:

* LL did not notify me of my right to get a pre-move out inspection
* LL refused to give me a pre-move out inspection (documented in email) 
* LL did not respond within 21 days of when I vacated the apartment and returned keys. LL claims he had 21 days from June 30th, but I moved out 10 days earlier and even saw him that day, he saw me leave in a huge truck (he actually tried to have my moving truck towed, which cost me $150), I told him keys were on the counter and that I wouldn't be back.

As far as the charges, all of them are estimates, no actual damages or receipts. $10k is from a contractor estimate, $3k is for a month's rent (he says work will take 4 weeks), and then $2k in various BS charges.... going to list them now.

1. He has quote for brand new granite/quartz countertops, because of a small chip size of dime in the cheap laminate countertop I had. There were already 4 other similarly sized chips in the countertop when I moved in.
2. In quote there is a brand new stainless steel sink and plumbing for sink, because of a 1mm x 4mm chip in the ceramic sink. (chip happened when cleaning a pan that slipped)
3. Brand new high end gas stove, because there is some carbon buildup on the cheap stove I had that was impossible to clean. It worked fine but it was stained even before I moved in (though it did get worse over 7 years).
4. Brand new high end dishwasher. He claims my (shitty and old) dishwasher is ""noisy and not draining"", which is true and I've complained about it. Isn't that his responsibility?
5. He wants $400 for ""custom drapes"" which were shitty drapes cut from discount material he did himself. A few years into tenancy he demanded I clean his drapes and didn't give care instructions, so I washed them on cold and they shrank.... he wants the $400 because they shrank
6. He wants $250 for not returning keys when he only gave me one set, and I returned two sets (I had a backup). I don't know when he's even talking about. 
7. He wants $250 for a broken toilet valve. My toilet didn't work last couple weeks of tenancy because the valve was an old compression valve that O-Ring wore out so it wouldn't provide any water to toilet, but he is saying I damaged it.
8. $190 for cleaning, when I left the place cleaner than I found it (and have photos to prove)
9. Couple other random bogus stuff


I'd like to sue him in small claims for the return of my $1k security deposit + double damages ($3k total) because he refused to do the pre-move out inspection and took more than 21 days to respond, and only included estimates not charges. Does anyone know what's going on with small claims court in SF / CA??? Are they even doing it with Covid stuff?

Ware and Tare

&gt; Wear and Tear
Most disputes over security deposits come down to what constitutes “normal wear and tear.” When a tenant moves out of a unit, the landlord may deduct from a tenant’s security deposit to repair damage to the premises that is caused by the tenant, but only for damage beyond wear and tear. A tenant should understand at the beginning of their tenancy what exactly is be considered “ordinary wear and tear.”

Security Deposit

&gt;Tenants should do a pre-move in and a pre-move out inspection of the premises. The landlord can deduct from the security for “ordinary wear and tear” but must account for those deductions in writing. Additionally, the tenant is entitled to the return of their security deposit twenty-one (21) days after they move out. If a landlord withholds a tenant’s security deposit in bad faith, they may be liable for the amount of the deposit and up to twice the amount of the deposit. END"

" Q: Great Uncle has installed a metal door and possibly listening devices in great-grandmother's home (among many other things). What can I do to help her?
T: GOOD
B: I can't even believe that this is a story I'm currently living through because it is that insane. At this point, I fear for my family member's lives and my great-grandmother's wellbeing. 

Here is the main point we are at right now:
My great uncle (great-grandmother's son), let's call him Paul. Paul has come home to Pennsylvania from Florida to visit, along with his wife and her children. While here, he threw away an unknown amount of items from her house, possibly took items home, and installed a huge metal door with fencing around it (imagine the metal doors that stores in bad neighborhoods use to close up at night) at the top of her stairs which lead to the attic. In the attic is his childhood room, which previously held 0 possessions of his. There is also a second bedroom and attic area full of my great-grandmother's items, such as winter clothing, home decor, christmas decor, painting supplies, and way more. She is now unable to access them.
 
This door was installed WITHOUT My great-grandmother knowing and without her approval. I am unsure if she approved him to get rid of or take any items. My brother believes he found a listening device in the home but that is not confirmed. I would not be surprised if Paul is listening and waiting to fly back at any moment.

A little more background:
My brother has been staying at my my great-grandmother's home nightly for the past couple months. Her husband passed recently and it was more so she could have company. He stayed in what used to be Paul's childhood bedroom. Paul and his wife stay in that room when they visit, so my brother cleaned it out but still had some of his clothes, a TV, an Xbox, and money in the room. This was all put away and shouldn't have hindered on their stay. 

This infuriated Paul. He threw my brother's items down the stairs. Told him to get everything and leave. Told him he is not welcome on the property ever again. He has gotten in his face screaming. We do not know why to this day. My brother is 18 and is beyond beside himself. He has been bawling and trying to figure out what he did wrong. 

My brother's girlfriend has also being staying in the home, with permission from my great-grandmother and her own family. Together, they have been helping my great-grandmother clean, cook, and keeping her company. 

On the night that Paul told them to get their stuff and leave, my brother and his girlfriend both went to the house to do just that. While there, Paul's wife grabbed a hold of my brother's girlfriend by the back of the neck. She said, and I quote, ""Come here little bitch. Paul, do you want to see me beat a little girl's ass?"" This occurred in front of my great-grandmother and the wife's children. My brother's girlfriend did not retaliate, she got away and went outside. She had done nothing prior and only said ""I'm going to get my stuff and am leaving."" 

Paul told my brother he is not allowed to step foot on the property. And if he does, he will find out and he will do something about it. I believe the exact words were ""there will be to hell to pay."" Paul does not own the home, the land, or anything. It will not even be left to him in the will because it is now owned by the bank. 

There is more that has occurred, but these are the major items. During all of this, my great-grandmother sat back and watched. She never asked Paul and his family to leave. I believe she is too afraid to do anything about it, but she has not admitted that. 

Some background on Paul:
Ex-army, ex-policeman, teaches gun classes, always carries. He has killed people (in war and as a police officer) There is a lot of bad family history as well. He is scary. My family does not visit our great-grandmother when he is here because we are afraid of him. I do not put physical harm or shooting us past him. 



I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't help because my great-grandmother isn't taking any action. I would love to know if there is something I can do to help her, to make him not be able to come back here. My family is afraid to go to the cops because my brother has been in some (minor) trouble in the past. I keep saying that doesn' tmatter but they are against it. Paul's wife is ""sue happy"" and would instantly try to make a case against us. And paul is very knowledgeable (or seems to be) in the legal system that I want to make sure my I's are dotted and T's are crossed before I do anything. 

I'm so worried and so afraid. Any advice is beyond appreciated. I will provide more info if needed.

###

","This sounds like a few issues going on.  Kicking out your brother was potentially an illegal eviction .  Threatening your brother is a potential police issue.  Taking advantage of your great-grandmother is potential elder abuse and theft.

How sound-of-mind is your great-grandmother?  Some of these behaviors (adding a locked door so Paul could have an apartment) are potentially okay if your great-grandmother is okay with it and competent to make that decision, but it sure seems like a red flag for potential elder abuse.

I would recommend contacting Adult Protective Services and the police.  DO NOT deal with Paul directly anymore.  Things like contacting APS and the police or getting yourself a lawyer isn't going to open you up to legal liability. END"

In the attic is his childhood room, which previously held 0 possessions of his. There is also a second bedroom and attic area full of my great-grandmother's items, such as winter clothing, home decor, christmas decor, painting supplies, and way more. She is now unable to access them.
 
This door was installed WITHOUT My great-grandmother knowing and without her approval. I am unsure if she approved him to get rid of or take any items. My brother believes he found a listening device in the home but that is not confirmed. I would not be surprised if Paul is listening and waiting to fly back at any moment.

A little more background:
My brother has been staying at my my great-grandmother's home nightly for the past couple months. Her husband passed recently and it was more so she could have company. He stayed in what used to be Paul's childhood bedroom. Paul and his wife stay in that room when they visit, so my brother cleaned it out but still had some of his clothes, a TV, an Xbox, and money in the room. This was all put away and shouldn't have hindered on their stay. 

This infuriated Paul. He threw my brother's items down the stairs. Told him to get everything and leave. Told him he is not welcome on the property ever again. He has gotten in his face screaming. We do not know why to this day. My brother is 18 and is beyond beside himself. He has been bawling and trying to figure out what he did wrong. 

My brother's girlfriend has also being staying in the home, with permission from my great-grandmother and her own family. Together, they have been helping my great-grandmother clean, cook, and keeping her company. 

On the night that Paul told them to get their stuff and leave, my brother and his girlfriend both went to the house to do just that. While there, Paul's wife grabbed a hold of my brother's girlfriend by the back of the neck. She said, and I quote, ""Come here little bitch. Paul, do you want to see me beat a little girl's ass?"" This occurred in front of my great-grandmother and the wife's children. My brother's girlfriend did not retaliate, she got away and went outside. She had done nothing prior and only said ""I'm going to get my stuff and am leaving."" 

Paul told my brother he is not allowed to step foot on the property. And if he does, he will find out and he will do something about it. I believe the exact words were ""there will be to hell to pay."" Paul does not own the home, the land, or anything. It will not even be left to him in the will because it is now owned by the bank. 

There is more that has occurred, but these are the major items. During all of this, my great-grandmother sat back and watched. She never asked Paul and his family to leave. I believe she is too afraid to do anything about it, but she has not admitted that. 

Some background on Paul:
Ex-army, ex-policeman, teaches gun classes, always carries. He has killed people (in war and as a police officer) There is a lot of bad family history as well. He is scary. My family does not visit our great-grandmother when he is here because we are afraid of him. I do not put physical harm or shooting us past him. 



I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't help because my great-grandmother isn't taking any action. I would love to know if there is something I can do to help her, to make him not be able to come back here. My family is afraid to go to the cops because my brother has been in some (minor) trouble in the past. I keep saying that doesn' tmatter but they are against it. Paul's wife is ""sue happy"" and would instantly try to make a case against us. And paul is very knowledgeable (or seems to be) in the legal system that I want to make sure my I's are dotted and T's are crossed before I do anything. 

I'm so worried and so afraid. Any advice is beyond appreciated. I will provide more info if needed.

###

","&gt; My brother was not legally living there, so I'm not sure of the circumstances surrounding that

That actually doesn't matter.  Even if your brother was staying there as a squatter without permission, he would still usually have tenancy protections (depends a bit on the state).  Though I'm assuming he had permission.  Even without rent/rental agreement/etc, he is still considered under to the law to be a tenant.

If your brother was living there for a chunk of time (depends on the state), to force him to move out requires a formal eviction, which requires a court order and then the police come to remove the person if he still refused to leave.  At no point would the owner or Paul be allowed to physically throw out someone that is living there.  Even just restricting access to the house by changing the locks or something would constitute an illegal eviction.

Her being of sound mind probably changes the outcome a bit, but I would still recommend contacting adult protective services and the police even if only to get their advice and feedback. END"
" Q: Lowe’s is selling inventory I ordered and paid for months ago.
T: GOOD
B: Edit: I live in Alabama.

About 3 months ago my wife and I went through Lowe’s to order and install new kitchen cabinets, countertops, and appliances. We had everything picked out, but we couldn’t get started because they were two cabinets short in store and the factory that made them were quarantined and not in production. Understandable. 

So we wait 3 months and eventually the cabinets trickle in. The salesperson called us and said they’d finally come in and are scheduled for delivery. Well, everything is delivered today and we don’t have the countertops or range, and one of the cabinets we were waiting 3 months for had been opened and marked down as a floor model for $25.00 when we paid $200. This cabinet came factory sealed and now has been a floor model (confirmed by the salesperson helping design the kitchen). She also told us that our range has been sold by another salesperson despite her removing it from their stock and they don’t have another one in stock and would have to order it. 

I’m pissed someone sold my range and I don’t have one at all. I’m pissed I paid $200 for a kitchen cabinet that someone opened and marked down to $25. They exposed it to the public and Covid-19. And my installers are coming today and I have no countertops or range. What are my options? I’d like references because I’m going down there to raise hell and I’d like to know what I can do and can’t do. What power as a consumer do I have? Thank you in advance.

Update: I went and spoke to the manager and they upgraded my range and found my countertops in their receiving department, but the bad news is the installer opened the boxes and two of my cabinets are cracked (one of which being the model put out on the floor). I hate Lowe’s.

###

","So, you have a bunch of cabinets, but no countertops and no range?

My response would be along the lines of ""Come take all of this stuff back and give us our money back.  This is for our kitchen.  How the heck are we supposed to use a kitchen without countertops or a range?  Why would we accept a floor model cabinet when we ordered a new cabinet?""  

That's your initial position: they screwed up so bad that you want to unwind the transaction.

From there, it's just a negotiation.  Chances are that the person you're dealing with doesn't have the authority to do anything and you'll need to talk to the store manager.   Do that in person, not over the phone and not by email.  At that point, you might back off the 'take it all back' position and instead take the ""You need to make this right"" position: ""Your salespeople SOLD our range to somebody else.  Your people put our cabinet out as a floor display.  Your people delivered the cabinets without the countertop.   This kitchen remodel is a disaster, thanks to Lowes.  What are you going to do to fix it??  And when will that happen?"" END"

","There is a difference between firing you for ""being pregnant"" and letting you go for missing work. If you are unable to work due to an issue during your pregnancy or after delivery and they let you go, that is not firing you for being pregnant. That is firing you for being unable to work. If you do not qualify for FMLA, which you do not, then that's not illegal. Firing you for being pregnant would be firing you while you can still work and the primary reason is your pregnancy.

" Q: Boss Says I Dont Make Overtime
T: GOOD
B: I am 18 years old and I work at a restaurant in Connecticut. I have been working 60-70 hours a week at my job as Both a waiter and bus boy. On my check I only had my 19 Hours as a waiter and my tips. The rest was given in cash which was not as much as I was expecting. I asked about my overtime pay to which my boss laughed and said you don’t get overtime here. I complained and eventually got some more money but not much. She claimed that she was saving me money on my check by giving me half in cash but I believe that I’m not being compensated fairly for the amount of work I put in. I make 6.38 an hour as a waiter and 8.23 as a bus boy plus tips. I would like advice on how I can calculate my checks starting now to make sure I am not being screwed over by my employer and underpaid. Also If there is any insight on how checks are taxed based on the amount of money on them that would also be great. I am willing it answer any questions if need be.

Update: there is some additional information I think I should provide and some more questions I have. Firstly I want to thank everyone for all the comments and advice I very much appreciate it. I’m not too familiar with employment law but I will look at the poster we have at work. Also We electronically clock in and clock out. I have started taking pictures every time I clock in and out just in case they try to change the times. some days I work all day, 10- at least 10. The week that this post was about some days I was work 13 to 15 hour shifts with no break, is that legal? A lot of people are saying that I should be making 1.5x min wage. For my instance is that 1.5 x $8.23? Or is it 1.5 x $11 (state min wage)? what sort of evidence should I be collecting? We do everything electronically at my job. Is it worth it to pursue this legally?

###

","Yes, you’re entitled to overtime.

Also, if you don’t make at least minimum wage with wages + tips then your employer needs to make up the difference.

Your employer is paying you cash because she is not reporting your income to the IRS. This could get both of you in trouble. END"

" Q: How can I get off a joint bank account shared with my adopted daughter? (Illinois, USA)
T: GOOD
B: We adopted our daughter from the Illinois foster system when she was 16.  She was not a US citizen (but did have a green card).  In order to help her attain citizenship we opened a joint savings account  with a regional bank right after the adoption.

After she turned 18 she drained her account and left without notice.  We assume that she is seeking out her birth family, but she isn't talking to us and we don't know what's going on in her life.

What we do know is that she's draining her savings account of any money put into it, and the bank keeps applying penalties because she is below the $200 minimum.  We put in a little money to cover the penalties, but then she'll find out and withdraw it.  If the balance goes below $0 the penalties are much higher, and we don't want to be on the hook for them.

We want off the account.  The bank has stated that we cannot be removed unless she approves it, so we feel like we're being held hostage financially.  She is the primary and we are secondaries.

Is there any way for us to be removed from the account?  What happens if the balance goes below $0?  Can they take the money from our other accounts?  Can we be reported to a credit agency if we move our other accounts and the joint account has a negative balance for too long?

","escalate with the bank. **also**, file a CFPB complaint. since one account holder is continuously OD'ing the account a racking up fees and you're trying to take action to prevent further potential losses, them preventing you from closing could be seen as unfair/predatory and therefore a UDAP problem. 

CFPB will not act on your behalf to make the bank take some specific action on your behalf, but a CFPB complaint will be routed to the bank for review and resolution and will go right past the front line reps that you've been talking to. it'll be treated as a regulatory complaint that they'll jump through hoops to resolve where possible. you can also file a complaint with whatever govt body regulates banks in your state; same as CFPB, where it's a way to get attention focused on your issue.

","NAL, but i do have 20+ years in banking.

if the bank says that they can't remove you at your request only, then that's that. they're likely advising you of that limitation because she'd have to sign a new signature card as the sole remaining account holder.

even though you cannot be *removed* without her cooperation, you should be able to just close the account on your own; each account holder will generally have the right to take that action independently. you'll have to confirm with the bank though.

to answer your question about it going negative, you are responsible for the account. the bank can take funds from any other account that you have to bring that account back up to zero, and they can definitely report out an account closed with a negative balance or pursue collections from you if you have no other accounts to pull from.

just close it and be done with it. your daughter can open a new account in her name only that you won't have any ties to. END"

","I am an IT guy and this is an IT problem, but to ensure a speedy resolution, you might try a multi-pronged approach:

The fence line next to their yard is filled with foil wrappers,  the kind the chocolate bunnies and such are wrapped in.  

I have video evidence of the child screaming and throwing toys at the dog over the fence as well as pictures of the foil wrappers.  

What can I do to punish these people to the fullest extent of the law?

###

","Civilly: you can sue for the actual value of your aged dog, the vet and disposal bills, and for the costs you incurred fixing the window your neighbours broke, within six years of the respective incidents, in small claims court. No lawyer is required. It's likely a net loss, as you'd likely have to do follow-up work to ensure you actually get paid, and especially as the value of an old dog is pretty close to zero.

Criminally: you can file a police report. If there's evidence the poisoning was deliberate, the neighbours might be cited for animal cruelty. Similarly, if there's an ongoing problem with them dumping trash on your yard, your local police might be willing to cite them for littering.

I'm sorry your dog died needlessly. If you feel you can no longer live with your neighbours, I understand: while the _value_ of a pet is often low, pets can be emotionally and personally very important. You might want to ask around for a referral to a good real estate agent and some movers, rather than a lawyer, as you have no meaningful option to force them to leave. END"
" Q: [WI] Neighbors autistic son killed my dog. I need these people removed immediately.
T: GOOD
B: So these people moved into the house next door last fall.  Their child with autism has been a major issue since day one.  We met these people 5 hours after they started moving in and their son threw a rock through our window.  They said they were sorry and that their son has autism, they offered to pay for the window. (never did)

","&gt; We will move if we can’t figure out how to get them gone.

I'd suggest tempering your expectations here because there really isn't going to be any legal mechanism to make your neighbors move. I promise you that I'm not saying anything here with even a hint of malice or judgement behind it, but I think you could benefit from some perspective here. The outcome you're looking for is to have a family move out of your neighborhood because they have a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder who has caused problems and now killed your dog. There's really no legal avenue that includes forcing people to move outside of some very specific situations that don't apply here. The fact of the matter is that people have a right to have a home, even if they're shitty neighbors. The most you can really hope for is the child being placed in a residential treatment facility, but you're really not in a position to influence that at all. The most you can do is call CPS, but I can almost guarantee you that somebody at the child's school is aware of his baseline functioning, and he's either not a candidate for inpatient treatment, or he is but there's not a bed available. 

I'm a dog owner and mental health professional. While I'm absolutely livid on your behalf, I don't think you're going to be able to reach the conclusion that you're hoping for. Good luck either way. END"
" Q: Dentist is attempting to extort my partner after (unfinished) work has already been paid for in full. Please help.
T: GOOD
B: First time posting. Edit: we are in Texas.

I will try to make this long story short:

My partner has already paid IN FULL for her permanent implant bridges AND HAS BEEN WAITING FOR FOUR (4) YEARS for the service to be completed. This man recently hopped from one office to another across the metroplex (come to find out he was responsible for the downfall of the previous one) and it was here (2nd location) that she was finally molded for her permanent implants in July of 2019. She waited for months until she was finally scheduled for the install at the beginning of March. THE MORNING OF HER INSTALLATION she received a call that her permanents were not at that location, and were instead at a NEW location back across the damn metroplex. WTF.

Then this whole pandemic outbreak begins- important detail.

Suddenly, while she's waiting to receive a date to receive her implants, she gets a call from a brand new clerk at this guys brand new dental clinic. This clerk states that she owes another $2,600 (now she's stating $6,500) when she has already paid $32,000 lol. She was the recipient of a grant and paid out of pocket in the first two years. In full. Not only does she have the paper work to back that up, but the paperwork this clerk sent her doesn't even account for all the money. There's something like $5,000 missing from their documents. My partner has all the paperwork so it's a joke that these people are trying this. The clerk repeatedly (we have recordings) requested my partner come in to discuss this in person AND stated if she came in the dentist could just finish the work. My partner declined because 1. Sketchy and 2. Coronavirus. She knows for a fact (via paperwork, receipts, and previous office clerks) that she owes no money and is certainly not going to risk entering the public for the uncertainty of actually receiving the implants.

Gets weirder:

Over the years she developed a personal relationship with this guy because he did in fact save her life with the surgery he conducted prior to developing her implants. She has always contacted him via personal cell phone and has even had appointments off the books, like when the first office would be closed for the day, just so she could get the care she needed.

Yesterday her temporary bridge broke, which is a huge problem if it falls out of her mouth because she will be unable to eat or even speak. So, she texts her dentist this morning letting him know it broke and asks when she will be able to receive her permanents. He beats around the bush, claims he needs to install new temporaries instead of the permanents he claims to have with him, and states that she needs to COME IN, IN PERSON to discuss this ""cordially"" with the front desk clerk what she ""owes"" stating that ""he's just a contracted dentist and not aware of finances."" Discuss what? Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something? This is, based on confirmed totals via bills, grants, receipts, etc. pretty clear that this is extortion.

Important points:

\-according to a previous employee of his, 7 other people are dealing with this. Unfinished services that were paid IN FULL.

\-his reviews on BBB also contain a multitude of people claiming he has done this to them as well.

\-there is zero proof that she actually owes money. no signed documents.

\-both he and his new clerk have repeatedly requested for her to come in, in person instead of discussing this via phone, email, etc.

-both previous offices have confirmed that there was zero balance remaining.

-the 2nd location has stated they had to stop allowing him to bring old patients in for unfinished work because it was having a financially negative effect on the company considering their services were already paid in full; therefore taking up appointment times for currently paying clients.

If you're reading this thank you so much for your time. Please help. We have some leads as far as lawyers go, however, we don't have one yet and not even sure how to handle it when we do. Any advice is welcome. Edit: updated “important points” as they develop

" Q: (MA) after giving me written permission to make a permanent decision, my ex changed her mind and has now decided to sue me for emotional damages. Advice needed--thinking of settling.
T: GOOD
B: I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. 

I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. 

My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. 

In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): 

""Jess, 
I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. 

At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. 

L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. 

As always, she would love to see/hear from you.""


she replied to that email a short time later with ""thank you for the update"". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. 

After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. 

In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:

""Jess, 
I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."" 

and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:

""Jess, 
In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.""

She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. 

We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. 

Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. 

I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any ""left"", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. 

A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for ""failing to offer her our shared child's cremains"" and ""offering a used necklace"" and some other nonsense. 

I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? 

I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?

","A cold truth: with the passing of your daughter, OP, there is no link between you and this woman. There is no reason to communicate with her besides through lawyers.   


I would exercise that right. It's the only sensible thing I would do if I was you. All the other things I would do in reaction to this... psychopathy... would be ill-advised and probably illegal.

" Q: Gf was kicked out of her house, denied access to her personal possessions, and bank account drained by family.
T: GOOD
B: So about 2 weeks ago now my girlfriend (19) was kicked out of her house at 2am with nothing but the clothes on her back for having porn in her search history (they searched her phone while she slept).  She’s moved in to my house and some of her stuff was put in garbage bags on the curb so we got some of her stuff back, just clothing and a few small items like teddy bears and stuff.  But all of her valuables such as jewelry, shoes, and anything that she was given as a gift for Christmas or birthdays was kept.  This includes all her money.  The family used the same bank so her grandparents she lived with had access. They had gifted her $3,500 as a graduation present but withdrew the money claiming it was a gift from them so they can tale it back. Is there anything we can do to try and get her valuables and or money back?  We are kinda broke so we can’t afford to fight it in court.

Also she is locked out of 90% of her accounts because they kept her phone and those phone verification codes go to that number.  They haven’t canceled the phone because they are using it to call people and pretend they are her to ruin her reputation with family and friends.   It’s a F’ed situation and we’re just looking for any advice or guidance.  Thank you for your time.

###

","1. Report the phone as stolen to the phone company.

2. She must call the police. Don't bring the backstory up. Make it as simple as possible: my grandmother locked me out of my house, stole my jewelry and clothes, and stole all of the money from my bank account.

3. Let her contact list know what happened.

4. She can sue them for wrongful eviction, defamation and conversion. The state in which you live changes the amount you can get back significantly. In California, she could sue for triple what was stolen from her, per Penal Code section 496 subd. (c), and one hundred dollars per day, see Civil Code section 789.3. You can also seek a prejudgment writ of possession/writ of replevin (again depending on state) for her jewelry and other things. I would personally sue in limited jurisdiction with a fee waiver (again assuming California), rather than small claims, because it is much more procedurally difficult to defend a limited jurisdiction case, if they try to defend themselves without a lawyer you can probably win by default by just slamming them with requests for admission and then moving for summary judgment, and you have the right to a jury trial and appeals. YMMV, again, depending on your state. END"
" Q: Gf was kicked out of her house, denied access to her personal possessions, and bank account drained by family.
T: BAD
B: So about 2 weeks ago now my girlfriend (19) was kicked out of her house at 2am with nothing but the clothes on her back for having porn in her search history (they searched her phone while she slept).  She’s moved in to my house and some of her stuff was put in garbage bags on the curb so we got some of her stuff back, just clothing and a few small items like teddy bears and stuff.  But all of her valuables such as jewelry, shoes, and anything that she was given as a gift for Christmas or birthdays was kept.  This includes all her money.  The family used the same bank so her grandparents she lived with had access. They had gifted her $3,500 as a graduation present but withdrew the money claiming it was a gift from them so they can tale it back. Is there anything we can do to try and get her valuables and or money back?  We are kinda broke so we can’t afford to fight it in court.

Also she is locked out of 90% of her accounts because they kept her phone and those phone verification codes go to that number.  They haven’t canceled the phone because they are using it to call people and pretend they are her to ruin her reputation with family and friends.   It’s a F’ed situation and we’re just looking for any advice or guidance.  Thank you for your time.

","That is an illegal eviction.  

She can (and should) call the police non-emergency line to have them come by and monitor, so she can access and retrieve her personal property.

She can sue her parents for the money. The gift cannot be retracted; that's her money. Small claims court may be an option depending on total amount and limits in your state.

&gt; The family used the same bank so her grandparents she lived with had access. 

Were they on her account as joint accountholders?  If not, how did they access the money.  She should open new accounts at a different institution, but this may also be fraud if they're not on the account.  Hopefully she's already contacted the bank and called police. END"
" Q: Upstairs neighbor will not allow anyone in to fix water leak.
T: GOOD
B: I live in Brooklyn, New York. On March 30th 2020, I reported a water leak coming from the ceiling of my bathroom to my superintendent. He came in the next day to inspect and said it was a damaged toilet pan from the apt above. He also told me they would not allow anyone in to do repairs due to the quarantine.

It has been over 2 weeks now and the leak is getting worse by the day. We have just heard back from the leasing management, they stated they have been working with the super to try to gain access to the apt. According tot the super's wife, the tenants will not let anyone in for repairs until the quarantine has been lifted and they can resume their lives as normal. 

I understand we are living in scary times but this is unacceptable. While the Leasing management and super state they have been trying to find a way to remedy this issue, we have been kept in the dark until today. If I were able to have the repair fixed from my apartment I would, but according to the super it must be repaired from upstairs. 

What can i do? Currently breaking my lease is not an option.

",Document everything as well. Any time you notice it getting worse take more pictures and document the increasing severity. Anything it damages of your document. Ultimately the cost of any damage will be on that tenant as he is refusing entry for repairs. You may also want to make that tenant aware that his refusal to allow the issue to be corrected will result in him being financially responsible for any damages to your apartment. END

" Q: Man signed birth certificate and isn't the father!
T: GOOD
B: 
I have a friend who I have taken care of off and on since she was 14. She only stays with me until she feels she is on her feet and then she leaves. My home is always open to her regardless of her problems in life. Years ago she got herself into trouble and spent 5 years in prison. She was released to me upon parole. We had some issues and she left. I hadn't spoke to her since September. I found out the other day that she was arrested for parole violation a month ago and then gave birth to a beautiful baby boy on Thursday. Here is the problem. The new boyfriend (of only 3 months) signed the birth certificate and took the baby because they didn't want him going into state custody. He is now talking about leaving the state since the doctors reported the baby having a bruise on his back yesterday.  I didn't know about any of this until Sunday night, didn't even know she was pregnant. Now she is wanting me to take custody of the baby, but scared to tell the guy, seeing he is threatening to leave. I know the real father and he wants to establish paternity and give me the baby as well... how can we go about this, without this guy taking off with the baby?! This guy seems to be on drugs, has a consistent record with violence, drugs,theft across many states. He also has no job and is temporarily staying with a friend in a tiny filthy room.
On another note, I am scared yet excited at the thought of having this baby in my care. I am completely capable financially, I own my home, vehicles, good job, very well off... but I've never taken care of a baby besides watching my niece here and there. 
If anyone has any advice or know a safe route to go about this, I would appreciate it greatly! I am located in Kentucky.

" Q: Bank removed $2,000 from my account and has not returned it — it's been a week
T: GOOD
B: I bank with TD. On Wednesday evening, I checked my bank balance on my app, and I saw that I had a negative balance. I'm not well-off by any means, but I have NEVER overdrawn my account or even incurred a maintenance fee for having less than the required balance. I saw that there had been a withdrawal for $2,000, and then a transfer of over $1,000 from my savings account to my checking account. I feared that I'd been hacked, so I immediately changed my passwords and called the bank. 

When I called the bank, they explained what happened, and I have to say that I've never heard anything like it. My father is joint on my account because I had lived abroad, and he had given me money for a visa. I wanted him to be able to access that money, so I put him on my account and just never took him off. I will say (because the bank tried blaming it on him) that my father would NEVER touch my money. He would be mortified if he thought this was at all his fault. 

Apparently, my father cashed a check at TD for $2,000. The teller was new, and instead of removing the money from the person who wrote the check (it was a TD check), she cashed the check against MY account. After calling the bank, they assured me that this was a normal thing to do if the check wasn't a TD check (which it was), because how would they know if the check written was ""good"" or not? Until the check cleared with the other institution, it is completely normal for *any* bank to cash against the account of the person the check is written *to*, not *from.* And, as my father doesn't have his own account at TD, it came out of mine, because he is joint on the account.

Apparently, the teller saw that I didn't have $2,000 in my checking account (because who does?), and instead of overdrawing my account, transferred exactly enough money from my savings to cover the check. Now, my father is *not* on my savings account. He should not have access to that money. Even if cashing against my account was the right move (which, I don't see how that's legal in any situation), she should *never* have touched my savings account. 

Obviously, I can't go into a branch right now due to COVID-19. I have called so many times, I swear they know my voice. It's been 6 days, and the money hasn't been returned to my account. I was told it would be in there within 3 business days (which is also unacceptable), and, three days later, it's still not back. I keep calling and I've already told them I'm taking my business elsewhere because it's absolutely ridiculous that this has happened, and they're being wholly unhelpful. I don't feel like they're treating this with the urgency that they should — they seem to think that, because I have *some* money left in my savings, it's ""not that bad"" and I'm ""lucky it isn't going to take 10 days."" Both things were said to me. Is there anything that I can even threaten them with, legally? This doesn't seem right.

TL;DR — Due to bank error, I have $2,000 missing from my account. It has been 6 days, and it still hasn't been returned, despite the time frame they quoted me coming and going. Do I have any course of action?

","&gt; Do I have any course of action?

Making a complaint to various banking regulators is pretty much the extent of your possible actions. (Technically, you could sue or threaten to sue the bank, but there is roughly 0% chance that is going to be useful.)

From many of the comments you have made, you are expecting that they should not have placed a hold on the money because it was an ""on us"" check -- a check from the same institution. There ARE fairly recent banking regulations that control ""on us"" checks[1], but they guarantee next-day availability not same day cashing of the check. If your father had not had an account (which he did -- as a joint with you) they would not have been able to hold money from the account. If your father had simply deposited the money then returned the next day to withdraw it they would have had to make it available (but still could collect from your checking or savings account LATER if the check turned out to be bad). But cashing it as he did I believe they are entitled to hold the money (make it unavailable for withdrawal).

The next question is how long they are allowed to hold the money for. Here, the times you have been hearing from the bank sound normal. Most are resolved within a few business days; some cases take as long as 10 days.

When this is all over, you may want to consider removing your father from the account if you do not have a reason to want him as a joint on it.

" Q: Bank removed $2,000 from my account and has not returned it — it's been a week
T: BAD
B: I bank with TD. On Wednesday evening, I checked my bank balance on my app, and I saw that I had a negative balance. I'm not well-off by any means, but I have NEVER overdrawn my account or even incurred a maintenance fee for having less than the required balance. I saw that there had been a withdrawal for $2,000, and then a transfer of over $1,000 from my savings account to my checking account. I feared that I'd been hacked, so I immediately changed my passwords and called the bank. 

When I called the bank, they explained what happened, and I have to say that I've never heard anything like it. My father is joint on my account because I had lived abroad, and he had given me money for a visa. I wanted him to be able to access that money, so I put him on my account and just never took him off. I will say (because the bank tried blaming it on him) that my father would NEVER touch my money. He would be mortified if he thought this was at all his fault. 

Apparently, my father cashed a check at TD for $2,000. The teller was new, and instead of removing the money from the person who wrote the check (it was a TD check), she cashed the check against MY account. After calling the bank, they assured me that this was a normal thing to do if the check wasn't a TD check (which it was), because how would they know if the check written was ""good"" or not? Until the check cleared with the other institution, it is completely normal for *any* bank to cash against the account of the person the check is written *to*, not *from.* And, as my father doesn't have his own account at TD, it came out of mine, because he is joint on the account.

Apparently, the teller saw that I didn't have $2,000 in my checking account (because who does?), and instead of overdrawing my account, transferred exactly enough money from my savings to cover the check. Now, my father is *not* on my savings account. He should not have access to that money. Even if cashing against my account was the right move (which, I don't see how that's legal in any situation), she should *never* have touched my savings account. 

Obviously, I can't go into a branch right now due to COVID-19. I have called so many times, I swear they know my voice. It's been 6 days, and the money hasn't been returned to my account. I was told it would be in there within 3 business days (which is also unacceptable), and, three days later, it's still not back. I keep calling and I've already told them I'm taking my business elsewhere because it's absolutely ridiculous that this has happened, and they're being wholly unhelpful.

","&gt; So it should have been taken directly from his account, no?
 
Not necessarily. There’s no requirement that they treat it as a conversion/cashing rather than a deposit. 
 
The key here is that the check transaction was treated as a deposit. Checks don’t clear immediately, regardless of where the account is. The bank can likely chose to honor it immediately - but fake check scams are popular enough that tellers are trained to try and help their customers. 
 
Then there was a separate withdrawal of $2000 cash against your account and processed immediately. 
 
Ask your dad for the cash, then pay him when the bank credits your account.
 
Checks shouldn’t be considered immediate instruments. All check based transactions should be treated with a 14 day hold.
 
Again, dad should open his own account at the bank that he uses frequently. END"

T: GOOD
B: Hey guys, I posted here a couple of days ago! It’s been past the 60 days and my old apartment forgot about me and my deposit. They switched management, and I was not in my system. 
I called and sent an email asking for the full return of my deposit of 500$. I attached the photos of the cleaned apartment. I got a check for only 30 dollars... and there was no itemized list of deductions. They’re also unlawfully keeping 470$ of my deposit since they forfeit that right after the 60 days stated on my lease. There was absolutely no damage and nothing to clean when I turned in the keys to that apartment. I feel so hurt because these people have acted like thugs the whole time I lived there and I don’t know what to do next, I definitely want to challenge them or everything else fails report them to some regulatory body. Any advice? Is it even worth it during this covid crisis? any suggestions are forever appreciated.

###

","Take one last customer service approach and ask them why they deducted and tell them that you left it in the condition that your lease demanded (assuming that's true). If you want. Otherwise, you'll want to sue them in small claims court. It's easy, and you don't need a lawyer.

Some states allow a 2-3x penalty to you if a security deposit is not returned in time. If yours is one of them, sue for that. END"

","&gt; Is it even worth it during this covid crisis? 

Yes, it is worth it. The epidemic is not an excuse to steal people's money or let people steal money from  you. 

Now I'm going to infer some unsaid stuff here, but if you said that because the idea of confronting them about his induces anxiety, I fully understand. However, if that's the case, I would like you to try this: write down a list of 10 things you could buy with $470. Each thing on the list could be one item (like a new phone), or a group of items that add up to about $470 (like 47 lunches at the sandwich shop you like), or even a mix of items (like a new toaster oven, ten fancy coffees, and whatever), but put together a list of ten of them and write them down. 

Now, look at each item on that list, and ask yourself ""If I already had this and these jerks asked me to hand it over, how would I feel?"" Of course you would be shocked and angry that they would even suggest it!

Ok, now that you're pissed off, go get your money back. I'm sure other commenters will tell you how. Sounds like you've already found the applicable laws (if not, do a search for ""tenant's rights"" and the name of your town, county, or state). As already mentioned, you may even be entitled to more than the deposit if they failed to return it in a timely fashion. If so, that penalty is also already legally yours. It already belongs to you by law. Make them hand it over. END"

Neighbors have cut down a row of trees and piled the limbs up in their front yard. The pile was at least 15x10 and 5 foot high and no more than 100 feet from two residences. 

They lit the pile and after 30 minutes the falling ash was too much covering the house and vehicles with a thick layer.

The FD was called and they put out the fire. They took a report for the fire Marshall to review and said to call back if they did it again.

","People are quick to tell you to go to CPS, but they never explain to you the function of CPS. If you report it to CPS, they may investigate it. I say may because I'm not sure it rises to the level of CPS intervention yet. When they investigate it, they will open a file on you, your mother, your mom's boyfriend, and your dad if he's still in the picture. If they feel the need to intervene but not enough to remove you, all will have to go through a safety plan together. That could mean all sorts of things, typically it's you all using whatever resources CPS has in your area, that could be workshops, programs, therapy, etc. If they feel removal is necessary, you will be taken out of your mother's house, your parents will become defendants in a suit brought by CPS where they allege you've been neglected/abused by your parents and you all will have to go through whatever reunification program CPS sets up for you. Yes, reunification, because that's the ultimate goal of CPS, to reunify the family. With you being 17 you may never even get to complete that program because CPS doesn't have jurisdiction over adult children. If you you have any siblings in the home, they could be affected as well. If CPS gets involved and wants to to take action, you all no longer have any control over what happens. You may not get placed with the family member you'd like to live with. You and your parents may have to do things you feel aren't necessary. You aren't guaranteed the same lifestyle you're currently living in. 

I'm not going to tell you CPS is bad option. If you feel you're in immediate danger, it is an option you can take to protect you, but it's an option you have no control over. If you feel like your mother has sufficiently handled it and you don't want the possibility of the above to happen, then maybe that's as far as you need to take it.

Edit: Some of you need to slow your roll. Stop telling OP that this guy is definitely going to escalate things. You don't know that. You can't predict the future. Stop feeding the fear. Also, stop telling OP that she absolutely has to tell the police and CPS. She doesn't. It's her life. You don't get to dictate that. She'll have to deal with all that entails going to those authorities, not you. END"

" Q: Employee that resigned in 2018 claiming unemployment
T: GOOD
B: Hi everyone,

Throwaway so I can share answers.

My mother (California, USA) is a small business owner with one other employee. Today, she received an unemployment claim from a former employee whose last day was December 31, 2018. My mother still has her resignation letter, stating that she left the company due to “financial decline” and intended to leave July of that year but Mom had requested she stay longer for her help.

It was a big shock for the office. While they did indeed lose a major client that year, there was no intention of laying off anybody. The employee decided entirely on her own accord so she could retire and leave for another state. 

Mom received the letter today, April 13th, stating that any complaints or reviews must be postmarked by April 10th. So, three days before she received it. Of course, she’s really concerned about it due to the times and the fact that the employee voluntarily quit. Called the EDD office number and received no answer, only a notice that they have a full mailbox. 

Is she liable to pay for the unemployment at this time? When she is able to get in contact, will the EDD claim that it has come in too late? If so, would she be able to fight that?

Thank you.

" Q: Employee that resigned in 2018 claiming unemployment
T: GOOD
B: Hi everyone,

Throwaway so I can share answers.

My mother (California, USA) is a small business owner with one other employee. Today, she received an unemployment claim from a former employee whose last day was December 31, 2018. My mother still has her resignation letter, stating that she left the company due to “financial decline” and intended to leave July of that year but Mom had requested she stay longer for her help.

It was a big shock for the office. While they did indeed lose a major client that year, there was no intention of laying off anybody. The employee decided entirely on her own accord so she could retire and leave for another state. 

Mom received the letter today, April 13th, stating that any complaints or reviews must be postmarked by April 10th. So, three days before she received it. Of course, she’s really concerned about it due to the times and the fact that the employee voluntarily quit. Called the EDD office number and received no answer, only a notice that they have a full mailbox. 

Is she liable to pay for the unemployment at this time? When she is able to get in contact, will the EDD claim that it has come in too late? If so, would she be able to fight that?

Thank you.

" Q: Employers preventing employees from filing for employment - Coronavirus
T: GOOD
B: Due to the shelter in place restrictions placed in San Francisco, I’m not able to go to work as work from home isn’t an option. Since I will be out of work, my coworkers and I all wanted to file for unemployment. However for the past month, my employer has done something rather shady. On my bi weekly paycheck, the pay code is “hourly sick” because they forced me to take my sick paid leave when I didn’t request it. And 24 hours of paid salary. (3/16/20-3/31/20). On my current paycheck, they used the pay code for “holiday paid vacation” and forced me to use up all my vacation days when I never requested them. Then asked me to come back into work for 4 days. Is this legal for employers to subject employees to take paid sick leave and paid vacation leave and asking employees to come back to work a couple of hours so we can’t file for unemployment since we are still being “paid”. Can anyone point me to specific regulations and laws that might suggest this is illegal or wrong? I want to be able to talk to my employer about it. I’m located in San Francisco with a small local company.

###

","I worked in HR in San Francisco a few years ago. California has a lot of protections around PTO. What’s likely happening is they’re trying to keep paying you as long as they possibly can before they have to lay you off. This probably allows you to keep insurance/other benefits you may have as well. California considers PTO to be an earned wage, so when you leave a job they have to pay this out to you in your final paycheck or an additional check. This may just be their way of paying you all out for any PTO you had on the books. Have you spoken to them about it yet? Are they planning layoffs? END"

I’m legally allowed to shoot at my property, confirmed by the township police. I have a neighbor who doesn’t like it and has been doing everything in their power to stop us. This includes: slandering us to other people on the street, calling their lawyers and state representative, yelling at us from our driveway, and blaring their car horn as they drive by our home. Lately, this involves calling the police on us. So far, we’ve had the police called on us three times in 72 hours. We’ve had a Sargent and lieutenant at our home. They’ve stated we have broken no laws but have to investigate every call. All for shooting a 22lr twice (no more than 20 minutes) in two days. Police say we cannot file a report for harassment. We feel like they are using the police to harass us. We’re at our wits end dealing with their shenanigans when we are not breaking any laws. We’re sorry they don’t like it but we are not in a residential neighborhood and I’m shooting away from their property in a steep hillside. Any advice or help, you can give would be much appreciated.

" Q: Just found out that I'm an illegal tenant and the landlord has given me 24 hours to leave. What rights do I have [VA]
T: GOOD
B: I'm a college student and these past few weeks was having some issues with my roommates. It was both a mixture of cabin fever from the virus, and some personal drama, but overall it just devolved into a toxic environment. The landlords of the property gave me a call and said that my roommate had complained about me, and they said that they'd let me out of my lease early so long as I left my house within 72 hours. Personally, I had wanted out of my lease for a while, so I accepted their offer, but that left me very little time to find a new place to live. I ended up finding a place to stay on Facebook for within my price range, so I contacted the girl renting it out and I moved in. Early today I got a call from my new landlord, and apparently the girl whose place I took never filled out the paperwork to transfer tenancy to me, and they are telling me to vacate the property within 24 hours. I asked them if I could fill out the paperwork now, and they told me no and I have to be gone within 24 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I just finished unpacking and this is a real pain in the ass for me. I'm a full time student and 24 hours is hardly any time at all to get all my stuff in order. Do I have any rights or special protections seeing as we are in the middle of a pandemic?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I only lived in the house for about 48 hours before the landlord contacted me, so I don't have any mail addressed to me, but I do have texts from the girl saying I could have her room

","Evictions are suspended. Nothing the landlord can do; whether your sublease on the property is legal or not, you leased the property from the current tenant and are therefore now a tenant. Even if you aren't, you're a guest of the tenant who hasn't vacated and he needs to serve you with formal notice, pursuant to § 55-248.31:01. Tell him that he can either work with you or have you living rent-free for as long as this crisis takes. If he changes the locks, call the police. END"

","IAL and practice in Virginia, 

Your in a tough predicament as you aren't a ""legal"" tenant and may only be a guest.  But the good news is in VA is that you still get treated like a tenant.  

Which means they must evict you.  While someone else has already said VA has suspended evictions.  I don't know if that's still the case (original order only suspended them until April 6,) I haven't looked for a new order yet. 

But either way, don't leave, don't give up the tenancy and if locks get changed call the cops and get an attorney.  

Otherwise, I wouldn't get too comfortable as the landlord can and will likely move for eviction quickly when the courts come back in session. END"

" Q: Ex-wife set up mail forwarding for our child to get his birthday money. Now she is going through my mailbox. IA.
T: GOOD
B: I am divorced and our time is 50/50 but my ex-wife has primary custody.  My son had a birthday a couple of weeks ago. A few weeks prior to his birthday I received a notice in the mail about mail forwarding having been set up - to be forwarded from my address to an address I had never heard of (but knew was not my ex-wife's address).  I assumed it was some kind of scam and contacted USPS and they canceled it.

Come birthday time we received nothing for him in the mail, which is atypical. I am fortunate to have friends and family who love my child and spoil him to death, so normally we receive several cards, but this year received nothing. However my parents and other family members did confirm that they had sent cards, including cash and checks, which we did not receive.

My parents sent a replacement birthday card and we did not get that either, so I contacted USPS thinking it was being forwarded after all.  They confirmed it wasn't being forwarded, but said that they have record of letters that should have arrived on specific dates, that we haven't seen.

I talked to my parents who confirmed the checks they sent were cashed, and after some sleuthing have figured out that the address used for mail forwarding, while not my ex-wife's, is actually her boyfriend's place.

The person I spoke with at the post office said this is murky territory because the mail IS being received by a legal guardian of the person it's intended for, but he understands it's ridiculous. He doesn't think I can do anything but is going to check with the postmaster anyway and they are going to call me back.  In the mean time he recommended a locking mailbox which I will be installing today.  He said I could report it to the police and that might help.

I filed a report of mail theft with the police but they were generally disinterested.

","I work for the USPS. 

You need to contact the police and file a mail theft complaint. Show them the footage you have. 

It doesn't matter who's name is on the letter, if it's sent to your address, then you are the responsible party. Your ex has no right or permission to retrieve any mail from that box, even if it has her name on it.  

You know she's taken cards, but what else did she take? 

File the police report, follow it up with a compliant to the Postal Inspector. END"
" Q: Ex-wife set up mail forwarding for our child to get his birthday money. Now she is going through my mailbox. IA.
T: BAD
B: I am divorced and our time is 50/50 but my ex-wife has primary custody.  My son had a birthday a couple of weeks ago. A few weeks prior to his birthday I received a notice in the mail about mail forwarding having been set up - to be forwarded from my address to an address I had never heard of (but knew was not my ex-wife's address).  I assumed it was some kind of scam and contacted USPS and they canceled it.

Come birthday time we received nothing for him in the mail, which is atypical. I am fortunate to have friends and family who love my child and spoil him to death, so normally we receive several cards, but this year received nothing. However my parents and other family members did confirm that they had sent cards, including cash and checks, which we did not receive.

My parents sent a replacement birthday card and we did not get that either, so I contacted USPS thinking it was being forwarded after all.  They confirmed it wasn't being forwarded, but said that they have record of letters that should have arrived on specific dates, that we haven't seen.

","Ok. Glad to hear she's away from him and that she's safe and with family. Please document and record everything and collect evidence. Since he's physically abusive, your aunt should pursue a restraining order against him. Please tell her to take photos of any injuries she sustained, e.g. black eye, etc. He might also try to harass her via email, chat,  text, and phone calls, please tell her to be careful. Since there is a lockdown in place, please make sure your aunt and her kids continue to stay together in one place. 

Please consult an attorney in Louisiana. They can provide specific and concrete legal advice for your state. 

Can you take a photo of the black eye? Also, call the police station, ask the officer at the front desk for his name, ID#, and email address. I would send a written complaint documenting the timeline of events with dates and request to file a police report. In your complaint email, state what happened, when, where, how, who was present, and how the husband reacted. Remember to send the photo of the black eye as an attachment so that it's documented in your email. Hope that helps!

","Unfortunately without registration documents that are dated before 1986 (when the registry was closed for collectible machine guns) there is no way to legally sell this firearm.  There is no way for you to check the registry, as there is no public access to the NFA registry.  There's also no way to legally own it, so I'd be real, real careful about talking about it online.  It's major felony territory to be in possession of an unregistered automatic firearm.  Your best bet to stay out of prison is to delete this post and find a lawyer, right quick.

","They should have sent it directly to the company. But in my experience as an adjuster, a personal injury lawyer might do it this way for a number of reasons:  

- They may have just made a mistake.  

- They may believe based on their client's story that the employee is personally liable for some reason.  

- They may also be trying to scare the employee into a personal settlement. This is less likely because usually these PI lawyers are *actually* targeting the insurance money. They know a janitor probably can't personally pay the amount they want. END"
" Q: Getting evicted because of snoring problem.
T: GOOD
B: *I originally posted this somewhere else and some suggested I post it here. Based in NYC*


My boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.

After 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is “old” with medical issues, he said there’s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.

We have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn’t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.

The next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we’d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their “safety”. 

So we’ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our “loud talking” at night.

My question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused. There is no way we’re going to find another apartment in 30 days.

","You should get a decibel reader. It would be nice to take a video using the decibel reader inside your home to measure how loud the snoring is in units that lady doesn’t live in. You have time to gather evidence since evictions are currently halted. I’m a sleep tech, and I agree that she should get a sleep study. She clearly doesn’t use a cpap already or her snoring would be gone or extremely quiet. Not to mention that untreated sleep apnea causes heart problems. This lady is going to have a heart attack, stroke, or both if she doesn’t start using a CPAP. END"

B: My family is preparing to leave an abusive situation with my father, and there's one thing left we're worried about; our dogs. We'd like to take them with us because obviously we love them, and we aren't sure if my dad would react violently toward them since no one else is around. My mom is afraid that if we took them with us our dad would pursue legal action just to be petty. I'm wondering what our options would be if at all?

","Dogs are property, so assuming your parents are married odds are they belong to both of them, so it wouldn't be 'stealing' it could potentially come up during a division of assets once (again I assume) they divorce, but no one is going to jail over it.

The police are minimizing policing of non-violent crime in most jurisdictions and I'm sure would be more than happy to go 'its a civil matter'. END"

I've never asked for or encouraged these texts. I have no problem blocking her, but she started coming to my apartment and dropping off gifts or knocking on the door at midnight in a coat with lingerie underneath. She will not take no for an answer. I haven't responded to her text messages since September but it doesn't matter. She won't stop.

I was very firm with her last time she came to my apartment in February. I told her I wasn't interested in seeing or hearing from her ever again. I did call the police and had her charged with trespassing and she hasn't been back since, but I'm afraid if I just block her again she'll either start coming by and I won't know it's her or her delusion will continue. Or the stay at home directive is lifted. 

She texts like we're having an ongoing conversation, or I've asked her to call me ""daddy"" (I haven't) or I've given her some reason to believe I want to see her again. She thrives on any attention from me, even negative attention, once saying that me asking her to leave alone aroused her. I know these text messages seem like funny memes but it's scary when I don't know what's wrong with this woman.

###

","1. Print out or backup all texts/emails/whatever from her. 
2. Write down a timeline including all your communications with police.
3. Physically go and ask to speak to an officer about your options ie a restraining order- you clearly do not feel safe with the possibility she will show up at your home. 
4. Change your phone number (don’t know why someone is being downvoted for a common sense suggestion). Make sure your friends/coworkers etc. know not to give it out. 
5. Lock down your social media- if you don’t use Facebook regularly just delete it. The same goes for Instagram twitter etc. Absolutely do not ever geotag your location when you’re out to dinner, in a park, etc. 
6. If it is a genuine possibility she could come to your workplace, I would consider talking to your boss or coworkers. Stalkers can be incredibly convincing and she may be allowed on the premises by someone not knowing the full story. 
7. I would consider securing my home if possible- a ring doorbell would be practical if your apartment allows it. END"

" Q: I am still being charged arrears and monthly child support for a child I’ve had full custody of the past 2 years. What do I do?
T: GOOD
B: I live in New York City.
My sons mother abandoned my son. I got a phone call from ACS one day and the ACS worker informed me that my sons mother wanted to give my son up because she couldn’t handle him anymore. (my son has autism) The ACS worker asked me if I was interested in taking custody of my son. I said yes and we arranged for everything to happen that weekend. I signed papers and was told I had custody of my son. I didn’t know any better so while I was still receiving letters claiming that I owed child support I thought nothing of it and thought the paper work was slow to catch up. I thought the same with his SSI checks when the ACS worker told me she told his mother that she had to go report that she was no longer the payer for my child. (No ssi checks for 3 months until I personally went over to see what was going on and found out she was still receiving the checks for him and still cashing them).
 His mother disappears off the face of the earth for literally 2 years. When she does pop back up she says she wants visitations. We go to court and that’s when I find out I didn’t really have “full custody” in their eyes because the paper work was from an ACS worker. But His mother didn’t dispute it. She said I could have full custody, she just as wants to see him once in awhile. We get through that, I’m told nothing about the ssi money she practically stole and gave him none of although I asked about it and even said it in court. I also told my lawyer(public defendant)about the child support issue.I’m being charged arrears and monthly fees for two years now. He said it would be in the final judgement yet the court papers I received do not state this and the public defendant no longer answers my calls.(side note: I lost my job and a lot of other things once I became a full time father. Autism isn’t easy, my son had a difficult time living with his mother his first 8 years. He wasn’t provided any help from city services or even special education because his mother didn’t find the time to get him the help he needed. No therapy, no nothing. Thankfully I was able to find the time to get him all the help and resources he needs but lost my job in the process. I’ve received a lot of help from my blessed mother but she can only do so much.)

my question(s)

(apologies for the deep backstory)

How do I stop child support from sending me letters stating I owe them money for a child I am in full possession of?
Do I still have to pay the arrears I’m being charged despite him being in my full possession during that time?
Has his mother still been receiving child support payments all this time (2 yrs) and if so what can I do about this? The IRS garnished my taxes last year despite him being in my custody? Did she receive a payment from that? Do I get this money back?
What can I do about the money she stole from my son’s SSI account? I have a letter from the IRS stating that she was the one who received the payments but was given no direction in what to do with it? Is this a criminal court matter? What can I do about this? 

I feel like she practically bailed on my son and got to steal from him with no type punishment whatsoever. Financially I’ve been put in a whole due to me taking a loan from a family member(written loan agreement) so that I could provide my son with the things he needed while I waited for the ssi checks to arrive that never did because she was stealing them. Needless to say I still owe this person money and I’ve tried to work to pay it off but my son doesn’t do to well in school so I’m constantly being called to pick him up. The 1 job I had after becoming a full time dad didn’t like that so I was fired after 2 months(surprised I lasted that long). Meanwhile his mother shows up to see him when she wants and does absolutely nothing to provide for him….
Thank you for reading this if you can this far. I began to ramble, sorry. This has been very frustrating and depressing….

","I AM NOT A LAWYER;

You need to apply for a modification of child support through the court. There is a form and a fee. When you get your court date, bring all your paperwork you have regarding custody, ACS paperwork included. If you lost the ACS paperwork, call the case worker or at least the office they used to work at and get someone to get you a copy of the forms. These will give you an established timeline for when you started having custody. then the Child support Should be modified to show that you started with custody on ""x"" date and they will calculate from there. Someone has to pay support, so more than likely they will order her to pay something. That amount will be back dated to the day (or should be) that you took custody from ACS. Make sure to have all your paystubs, bank records, tax forms and anything else financial with you when you go.  If this is overwhelming, look at legal aid in your area and see if they can get you a lawyer to help.

if you do nothing they will make you pay her  and even take you to JAIL for not paying. 

good luck END"

","&gt; And just to clarify she was still accepting SSI payments for my son while he was in MY custody. I don’t see how she would be entitled to that money in anyway possible when she wasn’t the one caring for him therefore she shouldn’t have been receiving his benefits. Benefits she used for her herself that were entitled to my child

In the courts view it was never notified that the balance of custody and parental duties had changed and a modification of the child support order was necessary. It's not the courts responsibility to chase down and check-up on every child support order and ask them ""is this still relevant?"". That's on you. When you received the first letter saying you owed child support, that should have been your first cue to follow up with the court, even if you thought someone else was taking care of it for you.

Child support is also for the custodian of the child, and while its intent is to be used for the child's support and upkeep, they aren't entitled to the money. END"

","You have to go to court and change the child support order. Until you do, your ex is entitled to that money, as crazy as that may sound. All that matters is that child support order. Child support going to the mother should be coming out of your money - are you saying you have no idea if money was going missing from your accounts? Or are you talking about some kind of money that's given because your child has special needs? 

Regardless, until you go back to court and get a real custody order giving you custody and change the child support order, you're still going to be racking up arrears. And you have to go through court to get the order changed, your ex can't change it herself. It was your responsibility when you took custody to get all of this sorted out, both with the courts and with whatever government program might be giving someone money to care for your son. END"

" Q: My 85 yr old grandma is in a rehabilitation center, being incredibly abused by staff. It’s taking forever to get her transferred to an assisted living place. Medicare says if I take her out of there myself, they won’t cover the 1.5 weeks she’s been there.. but I need to get her out.
T: GOOD
B: We’re in Ohio. She was transferred from the hospital to this rehabilitation center 11 days ago. The entire reason she was sent there is to gain back the physical strength she lost while sick with pneumonia. In the entire time she’s been there they haven’t gotten her up once.. which is literally the point in her being there. They haven’t bathed her, or changed her clothes. She’s still wearing the same unwashed underwear and bra from 2 weeks ago. Instead of getting her up to go to the toilet, they’re making her crap her pants and sit in it for HOURS. They’re mean to her. They were even mean to us.

They gave her a double dose of sleeping meds and benzodiazepines to make her easier to neglect. When she’d call us, she would just moan. She couldn’t speak. That’s how drugged up they had her. When we ordered them to stop, she went back to normal. They turned the ringer/outgoing calls on her room phone off for almost a week so we couldn’t reach her. When we called the front desk, they said she’s fine, just can’t talk. But she wanted to talk to us very badly, but couldn’t. There’s not even a working tv, she’s been staring at the wall this whole time. She’s weeping at me on the phone begging me to get her out.

And Medicare has the audacity to say they won’t cover the tens of thousands of dollars this abuse will cost my grandma if they don’t. Can they really do this? Can they really refuse to cover the medical costs if we save her from abuse?

Her life is in danger. When we visited, she pressed her call light and it took them 90 minutes to answer it. She has a condition that can close her throat and make her unable to breathe at any time. What if that happens while she’s here?? She’ll die...

I am contacting her lawyer ASAP. But considering it’s Easter I have no idea how long it’ll take and I need to get her out immediately. Like now, or worst case scenario in the morning. Can her insurance company really stick my grandma with the bill for abuse if I get her out? This place shouldn’t be paid at all.

Edit to add we are NOT in a covid-19 outbreak area. There are barely any confirmed cases in the whole county- there are zero cases in this facility. This is not the reason for the neglect.

" Q: Someone Shot Our Dog (Ohio)
T: GOOD
B: Yesterday, someone shot our dog.  we live in a suburban neighborhood, houses on lots of around .5 acres in Ohio.  Lots of cul-de-sacs and single family homes, very little access to major roads.  We had two dogs, both black with white and brown coloring on their chest and faces.  One long hair and one short.  My wife was heading outside to do check the weather to prep for some gardening around 11AM on Saturday 4/11, and neglected to fully latch the door.  The dogs pushed the door open and bolted.  Both are very fast, she ran inside to get her coat and shouted for me.  The dogs ran about a block and turned left, where we couldn't see.  When she got back outside, maybe a minute later, she found one dog coming home, more slowly, when he froze and collapsed about one house away.  I managed to catch the other one with the help of a neighbor about a block further away.

We got the dog home, and he was immobile, and struggling to breathe.  He's an older dog, around 11, and the other is around 3.  We thought at first that he was struggling to keep up with the younger dog or he was hit by a car, and the adrenaline got him halfway home, until we noticed a little bit of blood on his paw.  We took him to an emergency vet, they treated him for shock and x-rayed him, and found what appeared to be a pellet lodged in his abdomen, they also found the entrance wound.  He expired about two hours later.

We called the county dog warden, and posted to NextDoor (a local social networking app) asking for information.  The Deputy took our statement and the veterinarian information, and began  questioning witnesses.  Someone reached out on NextDoor the next day to report seeing it happen.  They saw two dogs in a neighbors front yard, heard a loud noise, one of the dogs yelped, and saw two men walk out of the garage facing that front yard a few moments later.  We gave their information to the Deputy, and he took a statement.  The Deputy tells us that because nobody saw a weapon or the specific act, and the folks who ""were implicated would not come forward"" he can't move ahead with charges.  The location that the witness claims to have seen the dogs matches the timeline, and location of the dog when he collapsed.

My Questions:  
1) Given the existing evidence, is it even worth pursuing a civil case in small claims for veterinary bills and replacement costs for the dog? (Roughly 1100 in medical bills plus some nominal amount for replacement)  
2) If yes, what are the steps involved in collecting the statement from the neighbor?

For Example:  
 a) Should we get a signed statement?    
 b) Would it be admissible in small claims court without the witness being present?  
 c) Should we have it notarized?  
3) Should we hold off on a civil case, and continue to escalate the criminal case with the proper authorities?  


Thank you for your advice.

","Thank you for your reply.  I think that you're right in regards to a civil suit at this time.

In response to your other points, our dog's actions are our responsibility.  I completely agree.  The individual who shot our dog is responsible for his own actions.  We're not trying to hold him/her accountable for our dog's actions, simply his own.  If our dog was threatening or violent, I would agree that shooting him is justified.  If our dog was running down the road as witnesses are telling us, I would not agree that a shooting is justified.

At this point, I think our best course of action is continuing to assist the Deputy Dog Warden in his investigation.  Another witness to the shooting contacted us last night, and we'll continue to help the deputy. END"
" Q: California: Asking for a friend: Friend's roommate put her dog down without her consent or knowledge
T: GOOD
B: Hi, my friend has had ongoing issues with her roommate and it has escalated to this. My initial advice to my friend was, ""save all your texts, and talk to a lawyer ASAP"" but I wanted to ask a few clarifying questions.

Here is the situation:

2 girls living together my friend(we'll call her Sarah) and her roommate (we'll call her Kate). Sarah has a Great Pyreness from before she moved in. The relationship between Sarah and Kate sours for whatever reason blah blah blah they're not on great terms. 

One day after a morning argument Sarah begins receiving texts from Kate saying that her dog bit her. As Kate texts she explains that she for some reason had hit the dog with a shoe and chased the dog to a 2nd room. The dog jumped up on the bed and when Kate continued to try to force the dog off the dog bit her hand. I saw the picture and there was no broken skin. I may be biased but I play rough with my toy poodle and he leaves bigger welts on my hand than this girl got. The roommate concludes the text argument declaring that the dog unfortunately needs to be out down.

This screams ridiculous to me but my friend Sarah is terrified that her dog is going to be put down. Animal control is called and upon conversation animal control doesn't even take the dog and admit it would be unethical to put the dog down. They also go to the vet and after hearing the situation the vet advises training and says it would be ridiculous to put the dog down.


Sarah comes home from work a few days later and the dog is gone. She panics and asks Kate where the dog is and Kate explains that she rehomed the dog with a family that owns land. While distraught at the loss of her animal Sarah eventually accepts that it's much better than being put down. 

Now we find ourselves a few weeks later and another argument flares up about something fairly stupid. Kate takes it upon herself to reveal that she actually DID take the dog and have it put down while Sarah was at work as some kind of weird hate filled spear she was saving for whenever they got into a fight.


Sarah is currently at a loss of what to do. 


My questions are: 

can Kate legally put down someone else's animal?


Can someone euthanize an animal without the owners will?


It seems so odd to me that Kate could walk into a place and have an animal she has no legal ownership of put down.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you!

T: GOOD
B: Like many American's I lost my job in 2008 and couldn't afford my mortgage.  I had a friend in a similar situation and he just stopped trying and said he'd move out when he got evicted.  I didn't feel I had much of a choice, so I did the same thing.  I was out of work for 15 months and never made a single payment during that time.  During this time I got several notices of late payment, notices of pending eviction, and then... nothing.  It never happened.  12 years later I'm still here and I haven't made a single mortgage payment.  As you can imaging during this time I also fell behind on my property taxes.  Eventually I was able to pay off the delinquent taxes, and I've continue to pay them on time every year since.

To be honest, I'm not even sure who owns my house anymore - no one has even mailed me anything about it.  I looked it up on the county records and I'm still listed as the owner.  

Now to my question - frankly the house is too big for me now and I'd like to downsize.  My kids have moved out and my wife passed in 2016 - I just don't need this house.  The county thinks I own it, how do I tell them I don't and I've just been living here rent free?  Ironically, I'm worried if I just leave no one will pay the property taxes and then I'll have a new problem to deal with.

","&gt;but I thought the UTMA was my son's, she's just the custodian until he reaches the age of majority?

This is correct. It's your child's money and she can't use it for personal gain.

Biological paternity is irrelevant. I don't want to pry into the particulars of your situation past where you're comfortable, but if you were married to the other biological parent at the time of/immediately prior to birth, signed a birth certificate, or signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, you're the legal father. 

UTMAs aren't conditional. Once money is transferred, it's transferred. Attorneys are free to send demand letters for any reason (I wouldn't send one in this circumstance, since I find it to be morally repugnant, but that's on the lawyer). They can't compel a paternity test without a court order. 

Keep in mind that Idaho does recognize grandparent rights for visitation. That said, your child's old enough that a court is unlikely to force him to visit the grandparents. If you need to go no contact or give them a time out, that'd be a reasonable thing to do. I would keep copies of any correspondence concerning paternity, the attorney's letter, etc. I'd also assume all future discussions concerning this were recorded and would just flat out refuse to discuss the matter until served with legal paper.

Regarding the UTMA - if they try to loot the funds it would make sense to speak to a lawyer and file a police report. END"

","If the baby is retrieved within the 14 days your parental rights will not be terminated.  It will be no different than if you just directly gave your child to your ex, and you will be liable for child support.

Parental rights are only terminated after the 14 day retrieval period expires.


As far as I know the only way for your ex to retain his parental rights while you relinquish yours would be through step-parent adoption.


Would your ex consider relinquishing the child for adoption if the adoption is open, allowing him contact with the child? END"
" Q: Mentally ill man invaded our home, caretaker just watched
T: GOOD
B: So this happened yesterday. My brother and his girlfriend came to visit us and our kids for the first time since quarantine began (they've been isolating entirely and so have we, we decided to take the slight risk to finally see family for a day). Normally, we keep our doors locked, but this time we left the front door unlocked for a bit after they arrived. My brother and I are both big dudes, so I feel pretty comfortable having the door unlocked for an hour or so. After a bit, we were all hanging out in the rear of the house (the front door opens to a short hallway next to the stairs) talking, and nothing is amiss. At one point, my wife noticed the front door was cracked open. We assumed my brother hadn't quite closed it all the way. She poked her head out to make sure our cat hadn't run out, and noticed a man we've never seen in our neighborhood before, just sitting in his car right across the street from our house, looking at her. She gave him a weird look and closed and locked the door. 

A HALF HOUR LATER, it's time for our youngest to take a nap (he's 2). She gets him up for a piggy-back ride upstairs, and as soon as she gets upstairs she starts absolutely screaming ""There's someone in our house!"" Apparently some guy was in our nursery, just sitting in my wife's rocking chair. So while my brother ran upstairs, I grabbed a weapon. My brother physically forced the man downstairs and out of the house, and when we tried to get him to stop and sit down, he just wanders off. Didn't run, didn't speak, just slowly walked off in a daze. The man across the street starts yelling ""It's okay, he's with me,"" etc. and between the confusion of that, and the fact that we don't want to be grappling with strangers during a pandemic, we didn't restrain the man. Probably should have, but we were all just shocked. 

As the intruder wanders down the street, the other man starts telling us that they're from a group home in the area, and he's the guy's 'caretaker' or something. He said he was with him, WATCHING HIM TRY OTHER HOUSES in the neighborhood. He won't give us a reason why he didn't stop the guy, or call the police. Something about ""I thought he knew someone around here"" was the best we could do, but his accent made it difficult to understand everything. He just didn't seem concerned at all about the fact that a man, who was apparently in his care, had just let himself into a stranger's home during a pandemic, and hung out inside for a half hour.

Ultimately, the police came and got all our information, and after a bit of a search, they did find the man and take him into custody, thankfully. The guy seemed to be pretty out of it, we couldn't tell if he was extremely drugged up or just really mentally incompetent, but the caretaker told us he was 'psychotic' so that makes me feel even worse. I suppose, as home invasions go, we're thankful that this was an ultimately benign incident, but we sure won't feel right for a while. Obviously we'll be more vigilant about locked doors going forward, and the odds of this are pretty minimal, but I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. (Yes, we fully disinfected the kids' room immediately)

My plans are: Get the name of the group home and speak with them directly. I want assurances that his 'caretaker' is fired, at least. I'd also like to press charges against the caretaker, if possible. Any functioning adult should have known that what was happening was wrong and done something other than sit outside and twiddle their fucking thumbs. I'm not sure charges against the intruder are very useful, if he's mentally incompetent. I'm also curious about whether a restraining order is a good option? I've contacted the police and requested some follow-up, and was told that tickets were issues, but I'm not sure how much that means. We're in Michigan, btw. Is there anything else I should be doing? Sorry for the wall of text, but this was just such a weird incident, I wanted to get it out there and make sure there's not something else I should be considering. Thanks, y'all.

Apparently some guy was in our nursery, just sitting in my wife's rocking chair. So while my brother ran upstairs, I grabbed a weapon. My brother physically forced the man downstairs and out of the house, and when we tried to get him to stop and sit down, he just wanders off. Didn't run, didn't speak, just slowly walked off in a daze. The man across the street starts yelling ""It's okay, he's with me,"" etc. and between the confusion of that, and the fact that we don't want to be grappling with strangers during a pandemic, we didn't restrain the man. Probably should have, but we were all just shocked. 

As the intruder wanders down the street, the other man starts telling us that they're from a group home in the area, and he's the guy's 'caretaker' or something. He said he was with him, WATCHING HIM TRY OTHER HOUSES in the neighborhood. He won't give us a reason why he didn't stop the guy, or call the police. Something about ""I thought he knew someone around here"" was the best we could do, but his accent made it difficult to understand everything. He just didn't seem concerned at all about the fact that a man, who was apparently in his care, had just let himself into a stranger's home during a pandemic, and hung out inside for a half hour.

Ultimately, the police came and got all our information, and after a bit of a search, they did find the man and take him into custody, thankfully. The guy seemed to be pretty out of it, we couldn't tell if he was extremely drugged up or just really mentally incompetent, but the caretaker told us he was 'psychotic' so that makes me feel even worse. I suppose, as home invasions go, we're thankful that this was an ultimately benign incident, but we sure won't feel right for a while. Obviously we'll be more vigilant about locked doors going forward, and the odds of this are pretty minimal, but I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. (Yes, we fully disinfected the kids' room immediately)

My plans are: Get the name of the group home and speak with them directly. I want assurances that his 'caretaker' is fired, at least. I'd also like to press charges against the caretaker, if possible. Any functioning adult should have known that what was happening was wrong and done something other than sit outside and twiddle their fucking thumbs. I'm not sure charges against the intruder are very useful, if he's mentally incompetent. I'm also curious about whether a restraining order is a good option? I've contacted the police and requested some follow-up, and was told that tickets were issues, but I'm not sure how much that means. We're in Michigan, btw. Is there anything else I should be doing? Sorry for the wall of text, but this was just such a weird incident, I wanted to get it out there and make sure there's not something else I should be considering. Thanks, y'all. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Mentally handicapped man from nearby group home enters our home unnoticed, goes upstairs and chills in our kids' room for probably a half hour or so. Man's caretaker sat outside and watched and did nothing.

","Yes, please contact APS yourself. I’ve worked in a community care center before and know for a fact that just because they legally are obligated to report this incident, doesn’t mean they will. Not only is this a scenario of your family being endangered but also this man clearly needs more support and help than what he is receiving. I mean what if his caretaker had just watched this poor man enter a home of someone who is armed? It would be a tragedy all around. END"

" Q: Dental surgeon didn't know what teeth to pull...asked my boyfriend.
T: GOOD
B: Hi, this is a throwaway for various reasons. I'll keep this as short as possible and will answer questions if necessary. I also don't post to reddit normally, so I'm sorry if this isn't right or is formatted weirdly.

I was referred to a dental surgeon by my dentist who I very recently began going to. The referral was originally for one tooth that needed to be removed and would eventually become an implant. X-rays were taken and sent to the surgeon. I called both offices to confirm. I went to a consultation, during which I explained to the surgeon that I woke up during other oral surgeries and that I do not react well to anesthesia. More X-rays were taken by the implant surgeon. While waiting for the removal appointment, I had a filling come out on the other side of my mouth and it ended up needing to also be an implant. Again, X-rays and updates were sent to the surgeon on March 1.

The day before my procedure, I was given a prescription for something to ""relax"" me. I was sent a consent form with teeth #30 and #19 to be removed in order to take this prescription. I signed the consent and scanned it back to the office. I took the pill as prescribed and it did not have any effect on me that I could tell. I let them know I felt nothing when I arrived for the procedure. I felt rushed through the paperwork when I went inside and was told ""we need to hurry we are behind"" (it was 7:45 AM). I paid what I owed in cash, for both teeth. I was given nitrous through a mask and felt nothing. I began to cry (because I wasn't feeling safe) and try to speak to the nurse, but she continued to hook me up to monitors and talk to people outside of the room.  I told them they would not be able to find a vein in my right arm, but they attempted anyway. The dental surgeon came in and found a vein in my left arm and started the anesthesia. Before I fell asleep, I heard the surgeon ask which two teeth to pull.

When I woke up, they had pulled one tooth. I immediately asked what happened and they responded that they could not keep me asleep long enough to pull the second. I refused to leave without seeing the surgeon, but they called in my boyfriend (he had driven me) and I was walked to the car. When I was at home with my prescriptions, my boyfriend informed me that they had walked out to his truck and said: ""she is finally asleep, do you know what teeth we are supposed to pull""? I was livid. I slept through the weekend and called them on Monday. At no point in the conversation did they tell me they had to ask him what teeth. They DID tell me that I TOLD THEM the wrong teeth numbers so they didn't know which ones. I asked if they had my records and my X-rays and they confirmed. I asked why they didn't consult the records and they said ""you signed the consent for the wrong tooth"". I hung up and contacted my dentist. She confirmed that my records were sent on March 1 again and seemed upset. Later, she called me back stating that I should trust the surgeon and schedule another appointment to have the other tooth removed. I called the surgeon and did just that. They informed me that I would have to pay again. I argued this. They stated I would need to pay for anesthesia, and because they couldn't keep me asleep, I would need to intubated, which would be more expensive. I stated that I already paid them in cash to remove two teeth. I asked them ""did you not remove the second tooth because you didn't know which one or because you couldn't keep me asleep""? They refused to answer this question and transferred me to fiscal. They informed me that they ""knocked $200"" off the price and will be charging me $150 for the second procedure. They also informed me that they called after the procedure to check on me and spoke to my boyfriend because I was sleeping. This never happened.

Note that this is not strictly about money. I am at a loss of what to do now. Do I have a case? Why didn't they check my records? Why did they not consult with me before they put me to sleep? Why did they not look at the X-rays that THEY took? Am I basically losing here because I signed a consent for the wrong tooth? I didn't even know teeth were numbered until this point. I am afraid to go back to them. I'm sorry this wasn't more brief.

Edit: I'm in Virginia

","I don't have an excessive amount of anxiety...I didn't request full anesthesia. It was required for the procedure, which was more than just pulling a tooth. I didn't think I needed to specify that. I wasn't the one that turned the situation ""awkward and confusing"". I was just a patient who followed directions. END"

T: GOOD
B: 22June2020. 

My daughter’s s ticket from San Diego to London in March 2020 was canceled due to Covid. After multiple phone calls to Expedia and hours on the phone she booked a ticket to London for the summer and was planning on spending the remaining quarantine with us, her parents.  Hopefully her university will be able to reopen for physical classes in the Fall.  When she was finally able to rebook the ticket Expedia charged more than the original price. They also said there were system issues and they could not give her a confirmation number but would email her. We eventually received confirmation of the booking from American Airlines.  

She tried checking in online the night before but was unable to do so.  When she arrived at the airport AA told her about issue and she called Expedia. It’s been more than three hours and the issue is not resolved.  She is still on the phone with them and does not know if she can catch a flight tomorrow. 

Do I have any recourse with regards to getting compensation from Expedia?  I care less about the money than I do about the feeling of helplessness we have as we are unable to effectively assist her from London. It’s making me physically ill.

","NAL but have first hand knowledge, as I used to work for Expedia.  I'll try to be helpful but there are some gaps here in your provided information.   I know this isn't legal advice but it doesn't sound like there's a legal remedy to this.

First, you don't say what the actual problem with Expedia is?  Or what you believe it may be?  Is it that their customer service unhelpful and slow?  Yes, it's awful and I saw that as someone who used to work there.  I never bothered with customer service and went directly to the airline carrier when there was a problem because ultimately they own the inventory they sold through Expedia.  Expedia just provides the platform to access the inventory.   So, it would be helpful to understand where you believe the problem may be with Expedia's service?

Second, have your daughter double-check that the confirmation she received from the carrier is actual.   Confirmations come directly from the airline and they issue the serial code for the confirmation, Expedia only sends this information along to the person who bought the ticket.   The first thing to determine is that there wasn't a breakdown in confirmation from the airline itself and that the confirmation number she was issued by the airline is valid.   It's rare but the airline can sometimes issue an invalid confirmation serial, which is an error on the airline's part and not Expedia.

Third, you are much better off attempting to fix this through the carrier directly.  It's their seat in their plane and their issued ticket.  Expedia customer service will be an intermediary in trying to make a change to a ticket or correct a problem but if the problem didn't result from Expedia's handling, they're also relying on the carrier to agree to a fix.  This is usually successful, but sometimes it's not.  

It's much better to work through the carrier 99% of the time.  If the customer service agent for the carrier tries to send your daughter back to Expedia, have her insist on speaking to a supervisor with the carrier. END"

","I don't work for Expedia, but I am a travel agent, which is what Expedia is, albeit an online one. If they were unable to refund the original ticket,  then they should have applied it to this new ticket. Exchanges are more complicated,  which is probably why they couldn't get it done during the initial call. I'd first check my credit card to see if the difference was charged,  and if so, there is likely a ticket number referenced on your statement (Should  begin with 001 since it is an American ticket).

" Q: [CA] CPS took my newborn son over a presumptive positive cocaine test
T: GOOD
B: \[TL;DR: My son was taken away by CPS over a presumptive positive while still at hospital. The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\]

My son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.

In this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to ""neonatal abstinence syndrome"" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.

At the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son ""tested positive for cocaine"" \[not presumptive\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said ""I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.""

By the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.

I find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to ""this is routine, we always change the case worker"".

Desperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.

Mar 4th ""Jurisdictional"" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.

I start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.

Finally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says ""I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted"". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!

2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says ""based on the \[egregiously err'd\] report I still find your son should be withheld"". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says ""mom is denying the allegations"". He says ""Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th"". My lawyer tells me I've made things complicated.

I thought this nightmare would end on Friday &amp; I'm still in utter shock it didn't. I live in SoCal where there aren't many attorney options I can find, or resources to help me. I'm a DACA ""dreamer"", all my family is in the UK. I'm stuck in a nightmare situation.

I haven't had more than 15 minute video chats with my son since they took him. I have a good home, full of baby supplies, gifts, and cute clothes he's already grown out of. I took his crib out of my room because I cried every night looking at it. I've never even had a speeding ticket, never touched cigarettes or alcohol while pregnant, and have never done drugs, yet my lawyer keeps telling me the ""bar is very low"" under dependency law - I just don't understand how I am still here.

I wish I had good questions. I guess they are:

* Is there anything I should be doing differently? I am told appeals court rarely goes against the lower courts.
* Is there grounds for a civil case that would maybe help motivate someone to help me on contingency? [I found this news article](https://www.theledger.com/news/20200311/mother-sues-hospital-over-false-positive-drug-test-that-led-to-child-abuse-probe)

This case is at the earliest stage, the criminal equivalent of an arraignment, and it's far from established that OP's representation is inadequate in any sense of the word.

&gt;You're completely speculating, and in doing so potentially spreading misinformation to a person in need.

Can you point to a single legal aid organization in CA that provides services to people with public defenders?  Just one?  Because I've been doing this for a very long time, and I've never heard of one anywhere in the state.  Not for criminal law at trial or on direct appeal, and certainly not in the far more specialized area of dependency, where there aren't that many practitioners in the first place.

I think it's unfair to OP to have her making dozens of queries to organizations that obviously can't help her, but please, if you know of *any* that provide services in dependency cases where the parent already has an appointed PD, please, enlighten us, and I'll happily stand corrected.

&gt;I would check your ego along with my spelling chief.

If you're holding yourself out as a criminal attorney, I would think you would know the difference between council and counsel and would want to correct an error so you don't look foolish.  I know I would.  But if you can't bear an obvious error being pointed out, well, you do you, ""chief"" -- but perhaps it's not my ego that needs checking. END"
" Q: [CA] CPS took my newborn son over a presumptive positive cocaine test
T: GOOD
B: \[TL;DR: My son was taken away by CPS over a presumptive positive while still at hospital. The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\]

My son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.

In this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to ""neonatal abstinence syndrome"" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.

At the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son ""tested positive for cocaine"" \[not presumptive\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said ""I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.""

By the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.

I find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to ""this is routine, we always change the case worker"".

Desperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.

Mar 4th ""Jurisdictional"" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.

I start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.

Finally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says ""I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted"". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!

2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says ""based on the \[egregiously err'd\] report I still find your son should be withheld"". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says ""mom is denying the allegations"". He says ""Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th"". My lawyer tells me I've made things complicated.

I thought this nightmare would end on Friday &amp; I'm still in utter shock it didn't. I live in SoCal where there aren't many attorney options I can find, or resources to help me. I'm a DACA ""dreamer"", all my family is in the UK. I'm stuck in a nightmare situation.

I haven't had more than 15 minute video chats with my son since they took him. I have a good home, full of baby supplies, gifts, and cute clothes he's already grown out of. I took his crib out of my room because I cried every night looking at it. I've never even had a speeding ticket, never touched cigarettes or alcohol while pregnant, and have never done drugs, yet my lawyer keeps telling me the ""bar is very low"" under dependency law - I just don't understand how I am still here.

I wish I had good questions. I guess they are:

* Is there anything I should be doing differently? I am told appeals court rarely goes against the lower courts.
* Is there grounds for a civil case that would maybe help motivate someone to help me on contingency? [I found this news article](https://www.theledger.com/news/20200311/mother-sues-hospital-over-false-positive-drug-test-that-led-to-child-abuse-probe)

\[Minor note: My friend helped me with this post and it's his account - I don't rape sloths!\]

###

","It's the elephant in the room here, but no one seems to be entertaining the idea that the CPS workers are corrupt. The truth is that newborns are valuable, especially white ones. If they have a diagnosis like ""neonatal abstinence syndrome"", the potential adoptive parents receive significantly more aid funds. 

OP - Your newborn is with another family that is trying to adopt him. Do not let the people here convince you otherwise. CPS workers are generally overworked folks trying to do the right thing. That doesn't mean there's not awful ones that will try to sell your child. There are. 

They've had ample opportunity to fix this. This isn't a case of something slipping through the cracks. This is either someone with a personal vendetta (unlikely) or someone that is getting some sort of gain from doing this. They've convinced a judge, and that's concerning.

You need a lawyer. Sell everything you own. Sell your blood. Beg. END"

T: GOOD
B: When touring my new house that's currently under construction, I've noticed piles of human fecal matter(and pee) at different points inside of the house and in the bathtub.

This is fairly offensive(and unsanitary) and would like to know if I have an actionable course to remedy this problem. I contacted the rep in the model home but no results have come from it. True, I can't really say for sure that they are doing it but I'm not an idiot and know they are the culprits.

###

","Piggy-backing off this comment chain for visibility and the above related info. IAMNAL, but I am a contractor in the state of CA. According to MD law, the Office of the Attorney General manages licensing for *new* home construction and the Department of Labor manages licensing for home improvement. The OAG's office lists a consumer complaint form:

 [https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/CPD/Homebuilder/index.aspx](https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/CPD/Homebuilder/index.aspx) 

However, I would contact the project manager, general contractor, superintendent, and/or tradespeople. Filing a formal complaint can cause headaches for you and them, especially considering your home building will likely be suspended indefinitely. Personally, I have seen people accidentally use disconnected bathrooms or use unsanitary areas when bathrooms aren't available. Although, I've never seen tradespeople use unsanitary areas like you've described, especially when there are portables available. It sounds more likely to be squatters or homeless people; which I have encountered ***a lot. A lot, a lot.***

As someone said in another comment, you'll get more with honey than vinegar. If the nice way doesn't work, file a formal complaint and pursue legal action. Wish you all the best in getting this corrected. END"

T: BAD
B: We have lived on a small pond surrounded by 5 houses for about 9 years now. Recently, an older couple (70+) has moved in and their adult children (30+ years old with children) are throwing bread into the pond and scooping up the turtles with a net (the first time we talked to them they said they're relocating the turtles). We have mentioned to them that we like the way the pond is and to please not take turtles from it, but a month later they're back at it. They stated that they want to remove turtles to stock the pond with fish (there are already fish in it).  
Our property line owns the majority of the pond, but I'm assuming their property owns the bank that they live on. The HOA states that no one should be feeding fish or eating the fish in the ponds. We have taken pictures of them doing this and submitted to the HOA in hopes that they do something.

" Q: Our landlady is harassing us about water usage during Covid
T: GOOD
B: A couple of weeks ago our landlady called us asking if there were any leaks in our apartment because her recent water bill (of the entire building) has tripled from last quarter. We told her no leaks but she proceeded to bug us about it every single day (calling me first thing in the morning to talk for at least an hour when I’m working). I tried to help her by saying since COVID started in New York my wife and I have been working from home, cooking every meal at home (tons of dishes everyday), obsessively washing our hands and sanitizing everything. I’d assume it’s the same for other tenants (10 units total). But she just refused to listen and made passive aggressive comments suggesting it’s us driving up the water bill. Absurd things like we might be using extra water washing our cat or washing my wife’s packages. She even said the water bill started to rise since April 2019 and we were the only people moving in around that time, but we moved in April 2018. 

I have no idea why she is accusing us. I know she talked to other tenants as well but I don’t know if she’s gone this personal with them. One day she asked my wife to go down by herself and talk about her business. My wife is a blogger and the landlady is acting like she’s running some water stealing business. My questions are

1. Does the landlady have any right to know the details of my wife’s business? The landlady is an old European immigrant who can’t speak English, so communication is hard enough, let alone making her understand what a “blogger” is. Also we don’t feel like giving her any information she could potentially twist and use against us. That brings to question #2.

2. My wife is in the process of getting her green card. Even though she’s not doing anything illegal, if the landlady decided to take us to court over the stupid water, would this affect her immigration application in any sort of way?

3. Our lease clearly states that the water bill is covered. What can the landlady even do if she decides we are using too much water (which we aren’t)? How much would be too much?

###

","Not a lawyer, but as a landlord, I know that I have to prove, by a metered, which tenant is consuming an over proportional amount of water, before I can address the issue. If she cannot prove that you are consuming more water than the others, then yes, it is harassment.

###

","The landlady cannot charge you extra for water (or water overage) unless each individual unit is separately metered. Each unit must also be metered separately from any building-wide outlets such as hose bibs or communal laundry rooms. She cannot just guess and start accusing or charging extra without any concrete measurements. She also may not back charge you for water use, even after installing individual meters.

She needs to deal with this like a professional and look for leaks. It's fairly easy to do if there are individual shut-offs for each unit. In most buildings there are, even old ones. That can narrow it down to individual units which can then be inspected for leaks.

Depending on what state you live in she needs to inform you in writing, in advance, of planned water shut-offs such as those which may occur when looking for a leak.

Good quality individual water meters can be purchased for around $160 apiece. My local water utility was offering $250 rebates per each meter installed on multi-family buildings. The rebate pays for the meter and cost of installation. END"

We have been home since the quarantine and I wash my groceries like crazy and never went over. You may want to check your toilet. I only say this because an old house I used to live in had a toilet that seemed normal but the water in the bowl was always moving and never stayed blue from the cleaner discs I’d put in the tank. I’m not a plumber so I can’t fully explain it, but it was running water constantly without a sound. It was causing a huge increase in my water bill at that time and I didn’t even know there was a problem.

" Q: What can you do if you were forced into a marriage overseas but live in the USA?
T: GOOD
B: So this was actually 5 years ago. My family was in Macedonia(my parents are from there) and then a week before we were going to come back my parents forced me to get married to a guy. 

We fought about this before but they were threatening to abandon me there and wouldn’t give me my wallet, phone or passport.
So on paper I’m married to some guy there. My parents did this for a number of reasons. They think I’m ugly, stupid, disabled(because I need glasses) and because I have a brother with adhd, no man would want me to have their babies because they could have adhd too.
I didn’t even kiss the guy. Which pissed him off because he kept wanting me to have sex with him cause he wanted to get me pregnant so I’ll be anchored to him.
The marriage was just signing paper a paper, but the guy literally asked “you want to get married and no one is forcing you to do this?” I said nothing. He said were married now. Everyone was pissed at how unhappy I looked.

Then after we came back to the us I filled an immigration spouse  application and paid around $500-600.
The next few months I was freaking out and was told “well, you were 18! You should have just said no! Just look on the bright side of being married!”
I was suppose to send in tax returns but instead I threw them into a McDonald’s drive thru garbage can. So, after that I ran away from home and spent a year being homeless and living in a women’s shelter. 
The people there were unhelpful, which is putting it nicely. But I keep thinking about how they kept telling me that my “husband” could come to the USA and take all my money!”
I was homeless. I had no money. And the people running that shelter were discouraging to all the women there and telling us not to get our hopes up of being successful. 
Well, now I have a year left in my undergrad and am actually starting to make money. I haven’t talked to my family or the guy.

Is there any way that he could come after me after all these years? Is there anything I should do? I don’t have any immigration paperwork. I threw all of it out.

I live in New York.

Turns out, he gave out a rental agreement to multiple people at the same time. This is the lease which includes all the rental property agreements.

T: BAD
B: Hi, I made this account today because I’m really upset right now and I need to know if I have any grounds to get this man to experience any type of disciplinary action.

I live in a small town in Wisconsin so the cops kind of know everybody. But there’s this one cop who keeps pulling me over for the most craziest and asinine reasons like I was too close to the curb or I stopped too close to the stop sign. He’s a young attractive cop and I’m young and attractive as well so I’m thinking he’s trying to flirt with me or something? But the situations are so aggravating and the things he says and does seem like he’s intentionally trying to antagonize me so that I’ll say or do something out of anger and he’ll have an excuse to escalate the situation.

But today he crossed the line. He pulled me over again under the guise that I wasn’t going the speed limit (it was 45 I was going 50) and when he came to my car and said his usual bullshit in the most condescending way he said he had to search ME, not the car, because my car smelled funny. My car smells like vanilla and I’ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he’ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don’t comply he’ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin type skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.

I’m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I’m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?

I have a GoPro in my car but idk if it caught this on camera I didn’t check yet.

","From the Wisconsin Department of Justice Website regarding filing misconduct complaints against police officers:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The place to start is usually with the head of the police department or sheriff’s office where the officer works.  Some departments have internal affairs units, whose responsibility it is to investigate complaints against officers.  In some cases, it is also appropriate to notify the mayor or town manager of the municipality involved.

 [https://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/what-can-we-help-you-find](https://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/what-can-we-help-you-find) 

&amp;#x200B;

Major cities usually have task forces for investigating police. In smaller cities it may be harder. But I would start as the DOJ website has recommended and then try to escalate if you don't get the expected accountability. END"

It also sends a quick text to a predetermined contact to tell them you've been pulled over, and it starts recording using the iPhone's front-facing camera. Once you've stopped recording, it can text or email the video to a different predetermined contact and save it to Dropbox. END"
" Q: A week prior to home possession, red flags are flying
T: BAD
B: I bought a house in Alberta, Canada. We are currently a week away from possession, and did a precursor walkthrough today.

Out of 9 stipulations on the sale contract, the seller has completed 2 of 9. There’s been 90 days of notice, and everything was agreed upon a few months ago. 

The biggest ticket item not done was the furnace, as a stipulation as it was older, was that the furnace would be repaired/serviced and given a clean bill of health by a licensed technician with receipts to prove the work was carried out.

The ‘receipt’ received is a hand written piece of paper with a company header on, looking through company records the company has not existed since 2019. My personal view is that the seller has gotten a buddy of his to write ‘all good’ on some old stationary and is trying to pass it off as the inspection completed and no faults found. 

I’m meeting with our lawyer on Monday, and I’m trying to figure out what has gone on as much as possible beforehand. In the contract, I have the option to withhold funds unless conditions are satisfied. What is my best avenue of attack on this?

" Q: [TX] Female in a male only work environment. Can my boss mandate I wear a different uniform to 'boost team morales?
T: GOOD
B: Please ignore the username. 

I am 19 years old and recently was hired for 9-5 job in a medical supplies warehouse. I work with 10 other employees, all men. When I first began interviewing, I came in interviewing clothes (skirts, dresses, full face of makeup). However, the job requires loading and organizing stock, along with placing phone orders. We are never seen by customers and everyone wears scrubs or a t-shirt and jeans.

I interviewed a second time in house last Monday and was set to begin work on Tuesday. I asked if it was alright if I went a day without wearing scrubs and my boss said it wouldn't be necessary 'for now' and specifically asked that I continue to dress in my business attire until further notice. I begin my second week of work tomorrow and have asked my boss for a third time when I should order scrubs. The work we do is physically challenging and I do not want to be lifting boxes or organizing wheelchairs in a button up, slacks, heels, and a full face of makeup (when I have to wear a mask anyway).

He informed me that I would not be allowed to wear scrubs or jeans and a t-shirt as the other men do, because it is moral boosting for me to come dressed up and, should a customer ever stop by (not possible as we do not handle distributions, only orders and storage) I must 'look good for them.

Is this legal? There is no dress code spelled out in the employee manual. I am the only person in business attire: even my boss wears jeans and a t-shirt.

We opened back up on Friday, however there were several coworkers (including myself) who had not yet received their test results and at least one who didn’t get tested at all.

" Q: A crazy Karen at Target wasn't wearing a mask and got in my face when I asked her to stop getting in my space repeatedly. It was like she was trying to provoke a scene and using me for an excuse. She screamed in my face and I felt spit hit my eye. I have a couple of questions.
T: GOOD
B: Location is upstate NY. 

This just happened and I'm furious. I very nearly slugged her because I was trying to back away but she kept coming. The only thing holding me back was that I'm 6'4"" and she's a small, petite woman. Didn't feel like going to jail today. 

I have no idea why she targeted me. I'm a tall white guy with a beard. She was short, petite, dark hair, wearing sunglasses inside, as one does. Maybe I fit the profile she went in looking for, someone a lot bigger than her. She clearly wasn't there to shop; she had no cart or basket and wasn't carrying anything, no items from the store, no purse. I first noticed her getting right up next to me as I was in the produce area. Every time I picked something up, she'd grab something right next to it or reach for the same thing I was, brushing my arm every time. The third time it happened, I said something like, ""Can you not?"" and that's the first time I noticed that she wasn't wearing a mask. Masks are required upon entry at that Target, so I guess she took it off once she was in.

That was literally all it took. She goes ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" and heads turned all around. Here's where I'll note that I'm an introvert and this is just about the last thing I want, ever. The rest of what she said is a blur to me, I wasn't listening to the words, I was just backing away trying not to lay a hand on this tiny psycho because I knew right away that ANYTHING I did at that point was probably going to ruin my day. She used the word ""rights"" a lot and the general theme was that I had no right to tell her to blah blah blah. Then I felt the spit hit my eye. She didn't actually hock a loogie at me, it was just spittle that came out as she was screaming like a banshee. I stopped backing up and she ran into me. I was immediately in a rage, staring her in the eye, so close to hitting her. I think she could tell because it stopped her for a second and she took a step back. I threw my basket down hard and walked away (my sincere apologies to the Target employee who had to clean up my stuff). She yelled something at me but I don't know what it was, my ears were roaring. I just wanted to get out of there before she took it a step further, because at that point I probably would have hit her and wound up in jail. 

I literally started writing this post in the shower which I got into immediately after I got home, but obviously, if she was infected, I probably am too at this point, given that I unmistakably felt her spittle hit my eyeball. Now I feel like I should look into getting tested. I'm beyond angry. 

I have two questions...

1) I am on the borderline of pressing charges. That, in my mind, was assault. Was it? How much of a hassle am I going to get into if I go down this road? I'm sure Target has it all on camera. As angry as I am, I really don't know if I want to go down a path where I have to get a lawyer, go to court... ugh.

2) This is a moot point now, but I find myself wondering... What would have happened if I did slug her? Is that self-defense? On one hand I wish I had, and on the other I'm glad I didn't.

As angry as I am, I really don't know if I want to go down a path where I have to get a lawyer, go to court... ugh.

2) This is a moot point now, but I find myself wondering... What would have happened if I did slug her? Is that self-defense? On one hand I wish I had, and on the other I'm glad I didn't.

" Q: A crazy Karen at Target wasn't wearing a mask and got in my face when I asked her to stop getting in my space repeatedly. It was like she was trying to provoke a scene and using me for an excuse. She screamed in my face and I felt spit hit my eye. I have a couple of questions.
T: BAD
B: Location is upstate NY. 

This just happened and I'm furious. I very nearly slugged her because I was trying to back away but she kept coming. The only thing holding me back was that I'm 6'4"" and she's a small, petite woman. Didn't feel like going to jail today. 

I have no idea why she targeted me. I'm a tall white guy with a beard. She was short, petite, dark hair, wearing sunglasses inside, as one does. Maybe I fit the profile she went in looking for, someone a lot bigger than her. She clearly wasn't there to shop; she had no cart or basket and wasn't carrying anything, no items from the store, no purse. I first noticed her getting right up next to me as I was in the produce area. Every time I picked something up, she'd grab something right next to it or reach for the same thing I was, brushing my arm every time. The third time it happened, I said something like, ""Can you not?"" and that's the first time I noticed that she wasn't wearing a mask. Masks are required upon entry at that Target, so I guess she took it off once she was in.

That was literally all it took. She goes ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" and heads turned all around. Here's where I'll note that I'm an introvert and this is just about the last thing I want, ever. The rest of what she said is a blur to me, I wasn't listening to the words, I was just backing away trying not to lay a hand on this tiny psycho because I knew right away that ANYTHING I did at that point was probably going to ruin my day. She used the word ""rights"" a lot and the general theme was that I had no right to tell her to blah blah blah. Then I felt the spit hit my eye. She didn't actually hock a loogie at me, it was just spittle that came out as she was screaming like a banshee. I stopped backing up and she ran into me. I was immediately in a rage, staring her in the eye, so close to hitting her. I think she could tell because it stopped her for a second and she took a step back. I threw my basket down hard and walked away (my sincere apologies to the Target employee who had to clean up my stuff). She yelled something at me but I don't know what it was, my ears were roaring. I just wanted to get out of there before she took it a step further, because at that point I probably would have hit her and wound up in jail. 

I literally started writing this post in the shower which I got into immediately after I got home, but obviously, if she was infected, I probably am too at this point, given that I unmistakably felt her spittle hit my eyeball. Now I feel like I should look into getting tested. I'm beyond angry. 

I have two questions...

1) I am on the borderline of pressing charges. That, in my mind, was assault. Was it? How much of a hassle am I going to get into if I go down this road? I'm sure Target has it all on camera.

" Q: Metro by TMobile let someone swap my cell phone number to another phone and now they won't help me.
T: BAD
B: Hi,
Thank you all in advance.

I have my family cell phone plan with Metro by Tmobile.  When I signed up with them approximately 2-3 years ago, I had to pick an 8 digit account pin to supposedly lock my account against transfer etc.  

Yesterday around 730pm I got a text message from Metro by Tmobile giving me a One Time Passcode.  I was in my living room and haven't made any account changes for a few months.

Fearing my accounts were under attack I frantically started locking my financial accounts and other accounts, and within minutes I started getting notifications and alerts that my different accounts were being tampered with, passwords changed etc.

here's the crazy part.  the password reset for my email account was my cell phone.  So because the attacker transferred my cell phone number from my phone to their device they were able to then request a text message to reset my password on my hotmail account and get the One Time Password.  The attacker got my hotmail account and then changed the password to my hotmail account and then enabled 2FA on my hotmail account.  

I was able to secure my financial accounts but they were able to get into my Authy account and remove all devices, luckily because Authy has a 24 hour hold on device transfer for 2FA swaps I didn't lose anything.

I went to a Metro By T-Mobile store at 930 this morning.  the customer service rep was actually very helpful and showed me the log of activity on my account, showing that someone did in fact activate another device yesterday and swap my cell to that phone. 

***Here's why I need legal advice***THE STORE THAT MY NUMBER GOT SWITCHED ON MANUALLY BYPASSED THE ONE TIME PASSWORD AND I HAVE SCREENSHOTS SHOWING THAT THE ONE TIME PASSWORD WAS BYPASSED BY THE METRO PCS EMPLOYEE

This suggests to me that the store employee didn't get a photo id and just let someone else swap my phone to a new device under the guise of ""oh I broke my phone and can't get the text message to unlock my acount"" 

Also, when I called in to MetroPCS today...the supervisor(in a call center....THEY TOLD ME ""OH OUR CORPORATE OFFICE DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER"") told me that ""we changed our security systems a few months ago and now the store employee can swap phone numbers to different phones and bypass the one time password if you have a photo ID"".... they clearly didn't have a photo ID because I..WASN'T THERE 

I'm sure whoever reads this can tell I'm upset, I don't know what to do, I call the call center and they tell me they can't tell me what store this happened at, which I don't believe at all...and then they tell me their corporate office doesn't have phones.  

How can I compel metro by tmobile to tell me what store did this????  I have screenshots...that even have notes in them from the employee that made the changes.  I have the employee ID number.  Metro is definitely trying to shield themselves at this point.

Can anyone help me? I don't even know what to do next.

edit: I am located in Massachusetts in the United States. Thank you.

###

","forgot to mention, I caught it as it was happening, called into Metro By Tmobile and I have re gained control of my account, but not until after they trashed my email account and gained access to mountains of personal data that was in my email...because they let someone get my cell number and access to my account without a password or pin.

" Q: Mail is being withheld from us for a “dangerous dog hold” on a dog that is no longer living.
T: GOOD
B: This may be long winded so I’ll add a TLDR at the end. This has been an ongoing matter for about a year now. Initially, we got a red card in the mail saying “dangerous dog, mail withheld” on a dog that had been at our residence for 10+ years. For whatever reason, the carriers decided the dog was too vicious and asked us to move our mail box away from the door (2 inch thick wooden door WITH a security screen, just as the postal service mandates) even though there was no way of him getting out. So, we complied and moved it to the fence along side our driveway, about 5 feet from the public sidewalk. All is well and we continue to get mail. Then, about 4-5 months later, our dog dies (old age, RIP). We kept our mailbox in the same spot UNTIL we noticed mail and packages going missing. Presumably they were stolen because of how easily accessible the mailbox was at this location. So we moved the mail box back to its original spot that it had been in since this house was built in like the 1940s. Again, all is well until about a month later, we receive ANOTHER “dangerous dog” notice in our mail box with no mail. We go to the post office to speak to the post master and ask “what dog are you referring to?” and we couldn’t get an answer. They just keep saying “move your mailbox”. We tell them ma is being stolen but they don’t care. Now the post master is being deliberately rude. We’ve spoken to multiple people including the post master and consumer affairs and they keep saying “we’ll have to come to a decision”. The dog is literally in ashes. There is no viable reason to withhold mail on a dog hold for a dog that doesn’t exist. So now, we have to go to the post office multiple times a week to pick up our mail, during a pandemic I might add. Sometimes they can’t even find it and we have to come back another day. But here’s the part that really set me off. This morning I go in and pick up a weeks worth of mail and I’m going through the stack and I find a bright yellow card that has our address on it, in bold letters on the bottom it says “do not deliver this card” so it’s obvious this is for the use of the post office only. On the back of the card, written in marker in all caps its says, “DOG HOLD FOREVER LOL”. It actually says “lol” at the bottom. Someone very obviously made a mistake by letting this get lost in my stack of mail. This proves to me that this isn’t a legitimate issue and they are just being petty for the hell of it. What can I do here? I refuse to move my mail box and let my mail continue to be stolen. What is my next step to get this resolved?

TLDR: Mail withheld for dangerous dog. Dog dies, mail still won’t get delivered. Petty note found in mail when I l picked up the mail from the post office. Consumer affairs and post master are not solving issue.

","Sometime ago we had an issue with the regional PO where we had a temporary box. We weren't receiving mail for several weeks but normally received anywhere from 10-20 pieces of mail daily. Numerous complaints were never responded to. Finally we called our Congressman. His office contacted the Postmaster General for our state who's office contacted us for more info. Several hours later we were called to come to the PO because they ""found"" some mail for us. It was two of those large gray trays they use overloaded with our lost mail. The Postmaster there said we didn't have to go so far complaining as they would have found our mail soon enough. My mother then told him that earlier that morning he himself insisted we had no other mail but after a call to our Congressman we had two trays full after only a few hours. He didn't like that. END"

I talked to customer service through a chat and asked for the footage from 1 AM to 3AM and I was told to check on my system for clips, I told them that nothing was recorded during that time and that I need to get those hours retrieved. I was told that that would be impossible since the cameras only record when they detect someone nearby. I told her what the rep told me and she straight up told me he lied about that. I asked her if she can give me a number to end my contract over false pretenses and she gave me a “loyalty number”. 

I call the number and I getting offered a life alert type device and auto repair insurance. I told them that I need to talk to someone who can help me cancel my contract and they would hang up. I called multiple times and the same shit happens. On my last call, I demanded to  talk to someone or I will file a complaint to the FCC and they hung up on my and blocked my number!

I called multiple times and the same shit happens. On my last call, I demanded to  talk to someone or I will file a complaint to the FCC and they hung up on my and blocked my number! I call and a voice message tells me that the number I am calling is not available in my area?! How?

So other than actually filing a complaint to the FCC, what else can I do?

" Q: Am I Responsible For a Single Bed Bug Found In My Apartment? (Michigan if that's important)
T: GOOD
B: A few months ago I found a single bed bug in my laundry basket it was un-fed and could barely move, this made it easy to capture. I took a picture and sent it to our land-lord, he came by to verify and had an exterminator come by two days later. When the exterminator he asked us if any furniture was new, we told him our couch was new, and he proceeded to check it along with the rest of the furniture and their crevices. He found absolutely nothing; he wanted to spray so we complied. Before we left the apartment for three hours, I asked the exterminator where he thinks the bed bug came from and he said ""It probably hitched a ride on someone outside and ended up in the laundry room, where it then found it's way into your clothes"".

A few weeks later the building manager sent me a text saying that the exterminator would be coming back in a couple of days for a second inspection. When he arrived he was not alone, he was with our land lord. After the exterminator re-checked our furniture and found nothing, the exterminator said he wanted to spray again and the land-lord not the tenant gave him the go ahead to spray again.

Fast Forwarding to the beginning of June, I get a bill for seven-hundred and five dollars. Five Hundred for the pest treatment (the two treatment sprays, one forced by the land lord after nothing was found), two-hundred dollar service fee to the apartment , and a five dollar late fee for every day late even though this was my first time seeing this bill (its much higher now).

Now this is where my lease comes in. Under the section titled PEST CONTROL it says:

"" The community is being treated on a regular basis. You are asked to assist pest control efforts by maintaining a high standard of good housekeeping. Residents with pets must pay an additional charge for de-fleaing. Bed bugs, fleas, cockroaches that are found in the unit or surrounding units and/or common elements of the property are to be treated at the resident’s expense. ""

If I'm responsible for treatment then can the land-lord request the exterminator to spray at my expense if nothing was found? The building manager has also told me that I'm required to pay because the exterminator determined the cause was my couch (even though he found nothing twice and previously said the cause was the laundry room). Also the lease says nothing about a $200.00 service fee (the apartment company literally did nothing). The property is also not treated on a regular basis. Can I fight any of this? I had a hard time finding what Michigan State Law says about this issue.

Also thank you in advance for answering my questions.

","NAL, but a landlord. 

The part of the contract you've pointed out does make you liable for spraying and pest control, but I'm unsure if it would extend this responsibility to pests that are not related to your occupancy.

Most pest control's have a warranty or guarantee that ensures their chemicals are safely deployed, and work to their expected standards. I suggest that you see if there are any guarantees from the pest control. 

I also suggest that you request any documentation from the pest control and the landlord that showed evidence that there was a pest problem. 

Don't use phone calls for official disputes with your landlord unless you have to. Email is best in most cases. END"
" Q: Upstairs neighbors keep dumping lighter fluid on my furniture. Do I have any recourse? Lake Elsinore, CA, USA.
T: GOOD
B: Writing for my fiance's sister and brother in law.

As stated, the upstairs neighbors periodically dump lighter fluid on my patio furniture. They have done a good job of avoiding me when I am outside but today I was out of view when they were pouring it. I peaked my head out and saw her holding a can of lighter fluid, and emptying it onto the couch, which she apparently had to lean over the railing to do. I asked why she was doing that and she quickly stopped and went inside her apartment. I have spoken with the management office and they document the occurances but i want this to stop, not just get written down every time it happens. They haven't stated whether they've spoken to the neighbors but if they have it hasn't motivated any change in behavior. In addition to the lighter fluid, they smoke on their balcony, which is overhead to my patio, and sometimes dump their ashes and cigarette butts, which have landed on the same furniture they're saturating with lighter fluid.

Are they violating any codes or laws by dumping lighter fluid on my furniture?
Legally speaking, is there something the management office is obligated to do but is failing to?
Is there something else I can do to help prevent future dumping?

Thank you for your advice.

Update 1: Called the police and was informed that the property must be permanently damaged to file a report. They also were not concerned that it lighter fluid. They did open a file and stated they'd put notes in it so there was a record if we wanted to go to small claims court.

",Call the fire department using the police report. This is an entirely unsafe and possibly lethal situation and you positively have to escalate. You may be able to break your lease if management refuses to deal immediately with the situation. You'd need legal advice to see if it's possible. But start with the fire department. Hopefully they will investigate in order to prevent a tragedy. If something horrible were to happen then the police will look bad for not taking real action  but hopefully the FD will do so. END

","Per the update, which is a *significantly* different series of events -- your friend broke the law by changing the locks; the other person did not.

The police were right.

No crime was committed by this man. Your friend has to abide the law and cannot just throw people out at-will for non-payment. This nation was founded on a handful of principles and rights, one of which is due process under the law. Just like your credit card company cannot seize your assets or have you thrown in prison for not paying your bill on time, your friend can't just eject someone from their home for the same. 

Your friend, OTOH, committed a civil tort in doing so, and if this person had not broken back in - could sue your friend for his costs in a hotel/moving services/storage, and potentially other damages as well. END"

B: A man broke into my friend’s apartment and is squatting there and refuses to leave. He called the police but they basically said they couldn’t do anything without an eviction notice. And this is in Indiana where eviction notices are suspended because of COVID-19. The police further informed my friend that he could not throw them out forcefully either. Any advice would be appreciated!

" Q: [NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago. My supplier is blaming UPS, UPS is blaming me and refusing to do anything. What can i do?
T: BAD
B: I run a hobby shop in New York state. I have a supplier who i have worked with for years, who typically sends me my product via UPS. 

UPS has been massively delayed due to COVID, i went from getting orders multiple times a week to basically almost nothing for the last 8 weeks. I had nearly a 100 packages sitting in UPS distribution center, some of them have been forever stuck in the state of ""Out for Delivery"" for weeks now, to things basically entering the black hole of the local distribution center weeks ago with no updates. 

This hurt my business pretty bad (which was already suffering due to COVID) as a lot of this stuff was items people had ether pre-paid or waiting for me to get my hands on. 

On June 26th when i was more or less in bed, i suddenly got a slew of delivery notifications from UPS around 10 pm. Since i live a good 45 minutes away from my store, i freaked out and by the time i managed to get there. The stuff delivered had been taken, i checked the CCTV for my store entrance and probably 10 minutes after UPS dumped the packages some people came by and picked up all the items and took off. 

I made a police report and passed it along to UPS as they had completely screwed up. On Friday i got an update and UPS had closed all my claims stating that it was signed for. The signature was basically the word COVID. Which from my understanding is UPS not requiring signatures due to COVID. 

The following blame is going around in a circle:

* My supplier is blaming UPS and how it isn't their fault, and tells me they fulfilled their obligation and i need to contact UPS. 
* My supplier doesn't have anymore of some of the products, so i can't actually fulfill many peoples orders now.  
* UPS is putting the blame on me stating that it was signed for and is refusing to discuss it more.

Am i able to do anything?

Ups just dumped my shipment in my front yard, not even my porch and didn't attempt to knock or notify me. I got a notification later that night and surprise, surprise my package wasn't in sight.

" Q: Can I legally refuse to lease to someone who smokes marijuana in my building even though they have a medical card (NJ)?
T: GOOD
B: I have tenants who have struggled with addiction issues and a prospective tenant has indicated they will be smoking Marijuana in the property under a medical licence.

Disclosure: Totally pro marijuana but that doesn't mean I think it shoold override the rights of my other tenants.

###

","The Federal supremacy argument is reasonably strong, but I would not rely on it either as a ""no criminal activity on the property"" action or a ""undue administrative burden"".   It just doesn't make sense to invite the requirement for a tenant to move in and then be subject to investigation, arrest, or conviction or have a court weigh in on the realism of the Federal DOJ changing its long-standing policy of noninterference, despite the 2018 recission of the Cole Memo.  To quote the President: ""LAW &amp; ORDER !!!"".

In NJ this spring, the state Supreme Court decided that MMJ patients are entitled to reasonable accommodations at work, despite the fact that the NJ MMJ law is silent on the matter.

So it's not impossible that a case will extend that disability protection to tenants, too.

Refusing to rent to this tenant because they have explicitly told the landlord they intend to violate the no-smoking policy is an unbeatable defense rooted in the fundamentals of contract law. 

No reasonable judge would rule that a tenant has the right to smoke in their apartment after signing a lease that prohibits smoking, and to my knowledge none ever has. END"

","Talk to a lawyer in your jurisdiction, but there are a couple of workarounds. 

1. Marijuana, medical or not, is illegal under federal law. A lease provision stating that violations of federal law violate the lease agreement provides protection to the landlord and is not at all unreasonable. 
2. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations to be made for disabilities, yet I'm not sure how, for example, banning the smoking of the substance in the apartment while allowing for edible use or smoking in an outdoor enclosure would not constitute a reasonable accommodation. You seem to already be offering reasonable accommodations, and you are not ""discriminating"" against any disability.

","Yes, he can revoke a voluntary conservatorship with 30 days notice to the courts. She could petition the court to have it changed to involuntary. The court would need to find that he has incapacity, as that finding is not part of voluntary conservatorship proceedings. 

As for changing to you, I'm sure that's possible. I couldn't find any specific proceedings for it but the court says they will appoint the person the conserved person chooses unless there is a good reason not to. You're his sister so I don't see any reason why you're not as good a candidate as your mom.

" Q: Verizon Wireless is threatening to send me to collections... I am not their customer. I have t-mobile
T: GOOD
B: I live in Utah.

This began to happen a few months ago. I needed a new phone since mine had stopped charging. I also needed it quickly since I was leaving on a trip. I called up Verizon and ordered a new phone with priority shipping. When it didn't arrive the next day I called them up again. They apologized and promised to overnight it again. It didn't arrive and I was leaving so the customer service agent thought the only way I would get a phone in time was to cancel my current order and pick one up in stores. I didn't really want to do this because of the pandemic but it was the only way so I drove about 45 minutes to the store.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got there they claimed that they could not give me a phone since I recently cancelled an order and there was nothing they could do to get me a phone. Frustrated I went to the t-mobile down the street, transferred my service and got my phone, hopefully to never have to deal with verizon again.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I received a notice that they would be sending me to collections if I didn't settle the balance on my account. I called up the Verizon customer service number and they confirmed and subsequentlly threatened me with collections if I didn't settle my account. The price owed was that for the phone order that I cancelled. So $900. I don't have their phone (the order was cancelled), I am not their customer. I did however notice that the taxes+fees associated with purchasing the phone was never refunded to my card. So by my calculations they owe me just over $100 (not a big deal but somewhat funny).

","&gt;Frustrated I went to the t-mobile down the street, transferred my service and got my phone, hopefully to never have to deal with verizon again.

You ported over your number, but there was no service ""transfer"".  You signed a new contract with T-Mobile.  Verizon probably automatically terminated service when they got the port request.  As a rule, balances on devices come due upon termination of service.

Now, when you say you cancelled the order, did you get a confirmation email?  Did it say the whole order was cancelled or just the delivery?

At the end of the day, depending on what was ""cancelled"", you may very well owe the $900.  However, in that case they do owe you the phone.

Your best recourse is to call Verizon and tell them you cancelled your order, and that you shouldn't owe anything (unless you had a balance on the phone you had).  If they stick to the story that your order was not cancelled, ask them how to get the phone you're being charged for. END"

" Q: Commercial Landlord continues to use space after leasing
T: GOOD
B: I have a friend who is starting an insurance company.  Being a startup, money is tight.  But they subleased some office space from a medical office.  It's basically one large room with its own entrance within the large medical office.   They just kept the door from their area closed from the rest of the medical office.

It was a 6 month lease, to see how things went.  My friend moved in, got set up, and got to work.

Then, Covid-19.  He and his partners stopped going into the office, because of the stay-at-home orders. (This is in North Carolina, by the way.)

But the other day he dropped by the office to get something.  He walks into his space, and it is full of people from the medical office.  Who are now doing a brisk business testing patients for Covid-19.

He didn't say anything that day, but just got what he came for and left.  Then he got angry as he drove.  He feels that they probably have been using his space for quite a while, since he hasn't been using it for around 3 months.

But he ***has*** been paying his rent, on time every month.  There are only two months left, and he wants out without paying those last two months.  His rent is $1,000/month.

I believe there are several factors in his favor: 

1) Their use of his space, for who knows how long or often, &amp;

2) Possible Covid-19 contamination, and re-contamination every time the medical personnel ""reinvade"".  (My friend's wife had cancer, and the chemotherapy did a number on her immune system, so Covid-19 is a real worry for them.)

He was angry enough to clear out all his stuff within days.  He isn't going back, but doesn't know if he has a leg to stand on if he doesn't pay the last two months rent.

What do you think?

","Yes, my friend sublet from the medical office.

So, I'm not quite sure what legal term you would use to describe a lessor that continues to use your space that you leased from them.  Breach of Quiet Enjoyment?

Plus, the fact is they had patients/clients in his space.  There is a high possibility those patients came to be tested for Covid-19. What other types of examinations were done there? Rectal prostate exams? Did they throw contaminated gloves in the trash can there?!? 

This could be very dangerous for my friend's family, so he vacated within a week of his finding this out. Could this be called Constructive Eviction?  (What little I know of all this is just reading what came up from a Google search.) END"

" Q: Commercial Landlord continues to use space after leasing
T: GOOD
B: I have a friend who is starting an insurance company.  Being a startup, money is tight.  But they subleased some office space from a medical office.  It's basically one large room with its own entrance within the large medical office.   They just kept the door from their area closed from the rest of the medical office.

It was a 6 month lease, to see how things went.  My friend moved in, got set up, and got to work.

Then, Covid-19.  He and his partners stopped going into the office, because of the stay-at-home orders. (This is in North Carolina, by the way.)

But the other day he dropped by the office to get something.  He walks into his space, and it is full of people from the medical office.  Who are now doing a brisk business testing patients for Covid-19.

He didn't say anything that day, but just got what he came for and left.  Then he got angry as he drove.  He feels that they probably have been using his space for quite a while, since he hasn't been using it for around 3 months.

But he ***has*** been paying his rent, on time every month.  There are only two months left, and he wants out without paying those last two months.  His rent is $1,000/month.

I believe there are several factors in his favor: 

1) Their use of his space, for who knows how long or often, &amp;

2) Possible Covid-19 contamination, and re-contamination every time the medical personnel ""reinvade"".  (My friend's wife had cancer, and the chemotherapy did a number on her immune system, so Covid-19 is a real worry for them.)

","Thanks for the analogy. I talked with him again today, and asked what they were doing in his space when he popped in and surprised them there.  He said there were two medical personnel interviewing an older couple.  A medical consultation.  So, the medical team is doing business in his rented space.

To carry your analogy even further, its worse than if the owner slept in his bed.  Its as if the owner let a person sleep there that came to get a test for Covid-19.  They might be or might not be infected.  But they made the bed before they left, so he wouldn't know that anyone had even slept there. END"

" Q: Landlord requesting us to move out if we want more children
T: GOOD
B: Hi all, my wife and I just had our first baby boy and are already madly in love with the little guy. We've been living for under a year in a rent controlled 2bd 1.5ba ground floor unit in San Francisco. The first floor unit has 3 roommates in their late 20s who we've been very friendly with ever since meeting them, while the top floor unit is where our landlord lives although she is out of the country for most of the year. We emailed her back in May to share that we were expecting and this was her response:

""Congratulations...  I’ve mentioned to my business partner that you are expecting a baby in June and I am to be blamed for not realizing a baby’s on it’s way when you’ve moved in.... 

Said and done, we are not sure how the upper unit would handle the sounds of baby crying and extra foot traffic, as the wall has poor sound proof.  Not to discourage you from having many more children in the future, but an advance notice, our Rental application &amp; Lease Agreements are for two person- maximum.   And we had wanted to keep it that way.  So, down the line, please consider another place to rent if you do decide to raise 2nd child and more in our building, even though you are wonderful tenant.  We need to keep everyone happy in our building.""

We completely ignored the email which was obviously out of line, harassing, and discriminating in our opinion. We are not confrontational so we decided to let it go and not even acknowledge it. We understand our rights under the Fair Housing Act and the city's tenancy law which does not consider children under the age of 6 as occupants, so she is really just trying to pressure us with no real basis.

She just got back a couple of days ago and started being extremely rude, barely saying hi and hinting at the fact that our common area smelled like garbage because of us. Nothing too substantial yet but we're talking about a very entitled person who has been passive aggressive ever since we moved in. In addition, our main bathroom has a major plumbing issue which causes the tub and toilet to clog every couple of months. She has acknowledged the issue is from the poor piping, as repeatedly pointed out by the plumber. She has done nothing to fix this issue even though she promised to handle the situation months ago. Every time it happens she expects us to contact the plumber, negotiate the price, pay him, and deduct the amount from our monthly rent, which should not be our responsibility.

We appreciate any advice on whether to take legal action if she were to continue to pressure us to move out or harass us. We have no intention of leaving for a while but also want to know what to do in case this escalates further.

###

","The point is, you should care about your neighbors and that should play a part in choosing where you live.  Some places have no sound proofing for crying babies or noise from your hobbies.  
You can talk to potential landlords about the unit and if it is good for soundproofing for your situation.  Do this before you sign.    

Most leases have clauses for noise.  Going into a unit to where your noise effects the neighbors could get you evicted.  It is best to find all the details up front when looking. END"

No, it shouldn’t, but if I were you, I’d gladly take on that responsibility just to make sure it actually got repaired in a reasonable amount of time. She’d absolutely put it on the back burner if you left it up to her.

Do you have this arrangement in writing? If not, *get it in writing before calling the plumber again.* Maybe just send an innocuous email asking for clarification, rather than making it obvious that you’re demanding something that can be used as evidence in a lawsuit. Hopefully it won’t come to that, but she could leave you on the hook for any expenses she deems excessive, so CYA. END"

","A neighbor may have called one in if they saw you weren't around doing your normal routine and didn't know you're away. It may have also been a concerned family member for some reason. It's hard to know and I'm not sure that you'd be able to find out who requested it. It's a bit suspicious that they would demand you come to the door if they could hear you were fine. They may have just been using the welfare check excuse to get you to come to the door to serve papers or a warrant or something of the sort but that seems a bit out there. If you are expecting some kind of contact with police like that just remember to only say something along the lines of ""I am fine and don't need a welfare check.""

","The general rule is do not engage with police. Never answer the door for police unless you are actually there. Do not give them more information than they are compelled to know by law (which isn't very much without a warrant). 

If your Ring rings again, and you're not home, don't answer. If they enter your home without a proper reason under the case law (warrant, plain sight exception, hot pursuit, community caretaking, consent etc.), their action was wrongful.

 Though, entering with a reasonable belief that somebody is in danger is likely okay (that would be the community caretaking exception). They could do that whether you're home or not. END"
" Q: I was in an accident with a decision from USAA that is extremely unethical. They based their decision on a verbal statement vs. actual evidence. My insurance is working with their legal dept. but small claims was mentioned? How/would this work? [NV]
T: GOOD
B: I was in an accident on 5/20/2020. I can go further into details if necessary. 

But essentially I was rear ended when at a stop while trying to get out of a speeding driver’s way in a residential area. I used my turn signal to indicate I would be pulling to the side of the road and left it on for 30 seconds before and kept it on until I was at a complete stop. I was stopped for less than 10 seconds when I was rear ended but the other driver. There was space for at least 4 cars in this area with no cars on either side. The damage to my vehicle clearly indicates I was at a stop when she hit me due to the sheer amount of damage her small car was able to do to my Subaru (it’s a sturdy lady). She actually lived two houses down from where the accident occurred. 

I did not call the police initially because it seemed obvious that she was at fault (I’m an idiot, I know). But she ended up telling her insurance that I was not leaving the roadway, rather ENTERING it. Which does not make sense with where the damage is on my car nor where the debris on the street is. I am now in physical pain on a daily basis due to this (I’m 27, I feel like I’m 80 now with how stiff my neck/back is atm). 

Her insurance (USAA) took about two weeks to even contact us with a decision after giving us a date we would receive a response by and ignoring our calls for 4 days. We ended up having to reach out to USAA on Twitter to even get a response and filing an executive complaint. We finally received a response not 24 hours later stating that I was at fault because it is my job to check traffic before entering the roadway. We contested this and had them review it again only to receive the same decision. 

 USAA refused to answer any questions on our end when given the decision. They also stated they were going purely off their client’s verbal statement as they did not send them any pictures (I have her husband IN one of my pictures taking a picture of her car).

My insurance(State Farm) upon hearing their decision immediately turned it over to their legal dept. as they saw the decision as being flawed as well. It was also mentioned that we might be able to take the other driver to small claims court. The lady that rear ended me works for the state and imo anyone willing to lie like that should not be working with sensitive information.

My question is, if I take this to small claims, who would I need to contact to get this started and would the outcome do anything for me? I was without a car for 25 days and as I said am now in constant pain with a fear of other cars (I know it’s silly, but on residential streets when cars come up behind me I get EXTREMELY nervous and am afraid to get out of their way lest someone hit me again then lie about it). 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

I am now in physical pain on a daily basis due to this (I’m 27, I feel like I’m 80 now with how stiff my neck/back is atm). 

Her insurance (USAA) took about two weeks to even contact us with a decision after giving us a date we would receive a response by and ignoring our calls for 4 days. We ended up having to reach out to USAA on Twitter to even get a response and filing an executive complaint. We finally received a response not 24 hours later stating that I was at fault because it is my job to check traffic before entering the roadway. We contested this and had them review it again only to receive the same decision. 

 USAA refused to answer any questions on our end when given the decision. They also stated they were going purely off their client’s verbal statement as they did not send them any pictures (I have her husband IN one of my pictures taking a picture of her car).

My insurance(State Farm) upon hearing their decision immediately turned it over to their legal dept. as they saw the decision as being flawed as well. It was also mentioned that we might be able to take the other driver to small claims court. The lady that rear ended me works for the state and imo anyone willing to lie like that should not be working with sensitive information.

My question is, if I take this to small claims, who would I need to contact to get this started and would the outcome do anything for me? I was without a car for 25 days and as I said am now in constant pain with a fear of other cars (I know it’s silly, but on residential streets when cars come up behind me I get EXTREMELY nervous and am afraid to get out of their way lest someone hit me again then lie about it). 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

T: BAD
B: I was in an accident on 5/20/2020. I can go further into details if necessary. 

But essentially I was rear ended when at a stop while trying to get out of a speeding driver’s way in a residential area. I used my turn signal to indicate I would be pulling to the side of the road and left it on for 30 seconds before and kept it on until I was at a complete stop. I was stopped for less than 10 seconds when I was rear ended but the other driver. There was space for at least 4 cars in this area with no cars on either side. The damage to my vehicle clearly indicates I was at a stop when she hit me due to the sheer amount of damage her small car was able to do to my Subaru (it’s a sturdy lady). She actually lived two houses down from where the accident occurred. 

I did not call the police initially because it seemed obvious that she was at fault (I’m an idiot, I know).

","If you went through State Farm for the damage for your vehicle they normally reserve the right to recover what they paid. That is normally not small claims court that is normally arbitration that both of these companies are members of. 

As USAA has denied your case you would have to see if a personal injury attorney would take your case. If they will that’s great as they will walk your through it. If not you would have to go to small claims court the problem you will run into is that it’s a word vs word case so with out knowing exactly what they said it’s hard for someone to be able to tell you how it will go.

* My sister is the independent administrator of my late father's estate.
* She lived at the estate house rent free for 2 years after my dad passed away. The estate covered all of her living expenses. A friend lived with her for about a year, and I believe that she was pocketing her friend's rent. 
* She pocketed a lot of cash, including the money people gave us at the funeral (intended to help us pay for the funeral) and my father's savings. 
* She sold the house at a huge loss when she decided that she no longer wanted to deal with the house or the estate. 
* She took $70K for herself, and tried to give me and my brother $400 each. The will stated for the estate to be split evenly 3 ways between me, my sister and my brother.
* My brother and I asked her for a full accounting, and she refused to comply. She distributed all the money before obtaining our approval. Now there's no money left in the estate account.
* During all this, the probate attorney sat around with his thumb up his ass. I called his office to explain the situation and request a full accounting, and left a message with his secretary. He never called me back.
* I hired a lawyer to sort out the situation. My lawyer spent 2 years trying to get a full accounting from the probate attorney. The probate attorney refused to cooperate with us. 

So now I just found out that the probate attorney is in the process of closing the estate. He did not even notify my lawyer. He's helping my sister get away with everything. My lawyer explicitly told him that my sister breached her fiduciary duties in so many different ways, she took more money than she was entitled to, and she was liable for rent. The probate attorney didn't even listen to my lawyer. He sent my lawyer an email a month ago and said something like ""I don't see any issues with how \[my sister\] handled the estate, and there's no money left anyway."" and then yesterday we found out that the court approved the final accounting and they're about to close the estate. There's one final hearing left before they officially close it. My lawyer said that he'll move to reopen the estate and try to settle with my sister in front of the judge. 

I know that I have a lawyer, but I'd like a second opinion. I'm afraid that my lawyer isn't doing what he's supposed to do and the estate will close without allowing me to present my case to the judge and fight for what I'm entitled to. Is this normal behavior from a probate attorney or did he mess up too? What should my next steps be? Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!

","Your final recourse is to sue your sister for breach of fiduciary duty. If she loses, she will have to personally cough up the missing money. Depending on local law, she may even get clobbered with penalties on top of that, and have to pay your legal fees. 

To do this, you need an attorney who specializes not just in probate, but in probate litigation. There are also attorneys who specialize in fiduciary litigation. If your current attorney isn’t an experienced litigator, ask him for a recommendation. END"

He never pulled the gun out of his waist so I don't know what it was he had on his waist, but I felt my life could very well have been in danger. Is this something I need to report to the police?

" Q: Coworker physically assaulted me at work and HR has done nothing about for a month. [MA]
T: GOOD
B: I’m not sure what I should do about the situation, or if this sub is the right one to post on, but let’s see. I could use some direction. I’ve revised the story a bit and withheld names and other identifying info. 

The incident occurred at the beginning of June. After having a conversation with my boss in the late afternoon after the incident, we both decided that the assault should be reported to HR, and so I filed the complaint the next morning. 

The assault took place in an office shared by 8 employees. Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don’t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated. So imagine my shock when this employee sicks a blow to the back of my head. 

The employee is “untouchable”, as in, he’s the best man we have on the floor (almost a supervisor) and he’s gotten away with many things in the past. He looks down upon others but will chat you up like you’re important to him. He likes to sound smarter than he really is. He mingles with upper management so he is well liked and well-received by them. He is my superior. This is important to note. 

Unprovoked and out of the blue, he comes into the office and, seeing that I was reading a book on my lunch break, smacks me in the back of the head, causing my glasses to fall from my face and onto my desk. It was a hard blow to the head, and throbbed some time later. Absolutely irate, I turned to face the offending employee with tears in my eyes as four of my office coworkers erupted in laughter at my expense. I didn’t think what the employee had done was funny in the slightest. I couldn’t believe he had done such a stupid thing, someone with his level of seniority and intelligence. 

I was shocked and angry. Through tears, I made it clear that I didn’t find the situation funny. The employee that hit me laughed at my response, as if the ordeal had been in good fun, and said “it was just a joke”. Keep in mind, we are all approaching our thirties and he is in his forties... really? He offered a pitiful apology and left the office while I sat there, astonished. I faced the laughing coworkers and said, ""I am glad that you all found that funny,"" to which they ignored me and went right back to working. 

After the incident, I was very visibly troubled and upset. I feel completely disrespected and unhappy, so much so that I was unable to sleep at night and have cried in the arms of my significant other. I have had to visit a therapist to process what has happened as I have an anxiety disorder and this has thrown me into a state of perpetual panic. I think, above all else, I’m taken aback by the lack of sympathy - upon seeing how upset I was, the employee did not take my concern seriously. I was hit, and hard - with enough force to smack the glasses off of my face. 

Please bear in mind that this is not the first time this employee has hurt me “in good fun”.  We’ve had issues in the past with him flicking the back of my head as I’m working at my desk or clapping extremely loud near my ears to startle me, as a joke I presume. These “jokes” eventually stopped when I asked him to back off. Because he stopped, I didn’t report the incidents to HR and figured we could just move past them like adults. He’s also, as I’ve mentioned, really well liked by the managers, so I didn’t want to be “that employee” that makes HR complaints. 

After an initial call with an HR rep from corporate, I haven’t heard a word in many weeks. Nothing. They said they were going to investigate and asked me what the outcome should be, and I said I wanted the employee terminated. Each meeting the HR rep schedules with me, she cancels and plans again for a later date. She’s done this 5 times now... citing that she is busy and can’t speak to me sooner. 

I sent an email to the HR manager saying that I wanted to reach out and discuss my concerns involving the incident and that I am concerned about HR’s lack of communication with me regarding such a sensitive matter. I said that I have messages that haven’t been responded to and I am deeply unsatisfied. I mentioned that I had to leave the workplace due to a panic attack on (date) and spent the remaining day in a state of paralyzing anxiety. As politely as I could, I explained that employees of the past have been terminated over lesser infractions, so I do not think it’s wrong that I feel unhappy about my company’s inaction. Towards the end of the email, I said that I only want to feel safe at work, and I believe - given the severity of the situation - that the employee should be terminated for violating workplace policies and harming me. Of course, I said everything as professionally as I could whilst holding back emotion. 

But alas, I’ve heard nothing back in days now. 

What can I do to close this situation, if anything? I’d like to speed up the process but at this point, I wish I had filed a police report. Maybe then they would take this seriously. I worry they will find a reason to release me from employment because I filed a report against the company’s “Golden boy”, and I’m feeling a bit defeated. They may fire me “for performance” or something of the sort... a gut feeling. 

Thank you guys.

I sent an email to the HR manager saying that I wanted to reach out and discuss my concerns involving the incident and that I am concerned about HR’s lack of communication with me regarding such a sensitive matter. I said that I have messages that haven’t been responded to and I am deeply unsatisfied. I mentioned that I had to leave the workplace due to a panic attack on (date) and spent the remaining day in a state of paralyzing anxiety. As politely as I could, I explained that employees of the past have been terminated over lesser infractions, so I do not think it’s wrong that I feel unhappy about my company’s inaction. Towards the end of the email, I said that I only want to feel safe at work, and I believe - given the severity of the situation - that the employee should be terminated for violating workplace policies and harming me. Of course, I said everything as professionally as I could whilst holding back emotion. 

But alas, I’ve heard nothing back in days now. 

What can I do to close this situation, if anything? I’d like to speed up the process but at this point, I wish I had filed a police report. Maybe then they would take this seriously. I worry they will find a reason to release me from employment because I filed a report against the company’s “Golden boy”, and I’m feeling a bit defeated. They may fire me “for performance” or something of the sort... a gut feeling. 

Thank you guys.

" Q: Step-father left me everything in his will - his estranged daughter is trying to contest it
T: GOOD
B: Hey everyone, as the title state - my stepfather recently passed away and left me everything in his will; including my childhood home.

My real mom actually passed away a few years ago, so I had been living with my stepdad through college. We even spread my moms ashes around a tree in our backyard, and I have always seen my stepfather as my actual dad and father figure since my dad was never around. My mom and him were never married, but they were together since I was 4 years old (I am 22 now).  A couple of weeks ago, my stepdad also passed away and I found out that he has left everything in his will to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My stepdad also has a daughter who I never really knew too well - she lived with her mom and moved to a different state than us when I was about 9. My stepdad always claimed that his ex-wife was toxic and always fed her daughter information that made her hate my mom and stepdad - and around 4 years ago, she stopped talking to my stepdad completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that he has passed away, she is suddenly back in my life and extremely upset that her name wasnt on the will. Her mom and her said that they are going to be contesting his will. I am worried that they may actually be successful because I was never adopted by my stepdad and my mom and my stepdad never married.

&amp;#x200B;

I could care less about having his stuff, but our childhood home means so much to me because its where my moms ashes were spread. I am scared that I am going to lose the last extension of my parents if I lose the home, and I am unsure what to do. I intend on getting a lawyer if they actually go through with contesting the will - but for now I wanted to check this subreddit to see if I had any ground to stand on.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: This is happening in Florida.

Edit 2: I also wanted to clarify that my step-fathers will has language in it that clarifies that I am his step-son, and that he is leaving everything to me despite having a legal daughter.

","&gt;but for now I wanted to check this subreddit to see if I had any ground to stand on.

It's possible. Wills can be invalidated for any number of reasons. Lack of mental capacity, the will wasn't properly executed, undue influence, etc. If they were left *nothing*, they really have *nothing to lose* by contesting the will. Without knowing more about the situation, we can't really give you an answer as to whether or not they have a viable case.

Get a lawyer, if you stand to lose a house, that's enough to warrant getting one. If you truly don't care about the other stuff, it could be as simple as agreeing to a settlement to get her off your back. END"

###

","First off, I want to thank each of you who commented to give me some advice and comforting words. I sincerely appreciate this community for helping me in this very difficult time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have read through all of the advice provided, and have taken the following steps: 

1. Determined who drafted the will, and contacted them to give them some information related to the situation. The lawyer I spoke with was very helpful in calming me down, and explained that the portion of the will acknowledging that his daughter will not be receiving anything will safeguard me should she contest his will. He also advised that should the will be formally contested he would be happy to present me with options for lawyers who can help at his firm. 
2. I have stopped communicating with my step-sister and her mother, as it ultimately seems useless to keep them in the loop. My only communication to them from here on out will be with regard to my step-fathers memorial which I have been setting up. 

Again, thank you so much to everyone who commented. I lacked confidence when I made the post this morning, and I am super grateful that you guys have helped restore that confidence. I will not be gaslighted into thinking that I do not have a chance anymore - this is MY childhood home and MY father, and should it come down to it, I hope the legal system will agree. Thank you to everyone for setting me straight and showing me the several ways in which this situation can unfold. I wish all of you well, and may make an update post in the future once this all settles. END"
" Q: (FL) Family member fraudulently using Samaritan's Purse charity services to have a new home built for them
T: GOOD
B: A family member (by marriage) has obtained hurricane relief assistance from Shepherd's Purse charities by way of having them build a brand new home as a replacement to one that was destroyed by Hurricane Michael. 

The original home and property were vacated by this individual nearly 20 years ago. He allowed it to lapse into severe disrepair while acting as a slumlord for a time. At one point vagrants moved into the house and lived as squatters there. For the past 10 years or so, another lowlife had been living in the house rent free in exchange for repair and upkeep that never took place. By this time, the exterior was falling apart, and a large picture window in the front was broken out and remained completely open to the elements with no effort made to even board it up. The roof was allowed to leak and the yard was overgrown.

Hurricane Michael caused several trees to fall on the roof, the city condemned the house and it was bulldozed. It came as quite a shock to see a new foundation being laid out on the now empty lot and a sign out front designating site as a Samaritan's Purse hurricane relief project. 

This person is now set to be handed a brand new house for free under the pretense that they’ve resided there all along and that their sole residence was destroyed by hurricane. There are plenty of residents in genuine need of services like Samaritan’s Purse and other charities offer, but the person in question already has a perfectly good home in a nearby town, where they have lived since abandoning the house that is set to be replaced.

Searches for Samaritan’s Purse application requirements, rules, or even guidelines have been unsuccessful. While I don’t necessarily agree with this particular charity’s stance on religious grounds, I also hate see them scammed out of the massive amount of money, time and effort to construct a new home for someone who doesn’t need their assistance due to the fact that they already have a home and haven’t lived on the property or in the house that was destroyed for the past twenty years!

I feel I should contact the charity and let them know what’s going on, but also wondering could this also be deemed as criminal fraud by this unscrupulous individual?

Given that even you don't know what the charity's criteria are or whether your family member misrepresented their circumstances on the application in order to meet those criteria, no one here is going to be able to advise you whether there is fraud here or not.

It's not clear to me whether you are asking whether you should be reporting this to the police instead or as well as telling the charity, or whether you're instead are hesitant to tell the charity because you don't want to get your family member into trouble.

In the former case, just tell the charity - I would do so anonymously.  They can then decide how they want to proceed and it's out of your hands.

In the latter case, it's hard to see what you would hope to achieve - get the charity to ask them to repay the money but not report it to the police?  I don't think that's a realistic outcome and you're not going to be able to tie their hands like that.  I think you need to accept that if there was fraud then it might be reported. END"

I run a successful online course, you can buy access to different parts of the course for a fixed fee or sign up for a yearly subscription where you can access all the courses and a community group. My business has been growing really well for the past few years now but this year when I had my annual holiday sale I noticed that i just wasn't getting the same sign ups or individual purchases of my courses.

Its not cheap individual elements cost $70 and the yearly subscription costs $325 but so far its always been a price people will pay. I thought it might just be the pandemic affecting peoples finances but after some digging around I've discovered that pretty much all my content is available online as torrents and downloads for free!

I use teachable but someone who has access has obviously copied all my content, text, audio and video and put it online for free and it has a lot of downloads. I have requested take downs on the file hosting sites but I don't know how I block the torrents? I can see  they have had a lot of downloads and I've even found threads online where people are sharing the links and thanking each other for the money the will save!

Is it possible to find out who is responsible and if not is it possible to block any more downloads?

","I had a similar experience a few years ago. School bus stop across the street from my house but kids were all over my lawn and plants, in my driveway, etc. I asked them to stop, politely, to no avail. 

I called the school district and told them my address and they put me in touch with the ""bus guy?"" I guess? Anyways, told him what was up and he told me that school bus stops are considered school property while the kids are waiting there and upon getting off the bus, and are expected to adhere to school rules whole at the bus stop.

The next day he came out, parked down the street and saw them making havock not just in my yard, but other neighbors yards as well (riding bikes on other people's property, etc)

He came up and spoke with them, seemed to take down their names and stood there til the bus came and seemed to have a lengthy talk with the bus driver. 

The stop wasn't able to be moved, but we have never had the issue again and after a while the kids either moved away or went to another school (high school) with a different stop.

Reach out to the school. They may be more helpful than you think.

(Now I have a group of lovely middle schoolers who are very polite, stand at the end of the driveway and don't make a peep. They have even retrieved some mail of mine that blew into the street. The other kids would have probably stolen my identity had they found my mail 🤣🤣) END"

","You first have to determine if it is in fact your property. 

If it is your property, and you know these kids use it, and you know there is a potential hazard, then you could be held liable. 

That you allow the kids to use your property makes them “invitees”. Property owners have a duty to protect their invitees from hazards they know or should know about. 

Even if they are not invitees, property owners have a duty to maintain their property in a safe condition, particularly when they have notice that others are using that property. You are aware they use this property, therefore you have notice. 

In addition, you have notice of the potential hazard. 

Again, this duty only exists if you are in fact the property owner. END"

","There’s probably an easement that makes part of your yard the property of your city or county (the initial 5 feet starting from the street is common but I imagine that varies). 

So it’s likely OK for the kids to stand at the edge of the yard within that easement, but it sounds like the little ones are going rogue. I imagine your liability would be the same as it would be for anybody else just poking around the yard without permission. Contact the school district and ask for help controlling the kids—it’s the district’s job to deal with problems at the bus stop. END"

T: GOOD
B: I checked the sticky post but didn't see anything that addressed this issue. 

My wife is a labor and delivery (L&amp;D) nurse in Virginia, and she is 20 weeks pregnant. Her department tests all incoming L&amp;D patients for Covid-19. After we found out that she is pregnant, her doctor provided a note advising that she no longer work with Covid-positive patients, as pregnant women are at higher risk for severe Covid illness. The hospital provided this accommodation for her. The doctor also advised against getting the vaccine while pregnant, since it is not approved for pregnant women and there is no data regarding the vaccine and pregnancy. 

With the current Covid spike, her hospital's Covid-19 floor is losing nurses - some are quitting and many are getting sick. My wife is now being told that she needs to work shifts on the Covid floor despite the following factors:

- She is NOT a med-surg nurse and has no expertise in caring for Covid patients
- According to the CDC, pregnant women are immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19
- Her doctor (who works at this hospital) strongly advises her against any exposure to Covid patients; the doctor has also directly communicated this to my wife's supervisor
- She is one of the very few pregnant nurses, and one of the only nurses that will not receive the vaccine within the next month; this means that almost all other nurses will have essentially no risk of illness while working with Covid-19 patients 

I'm aware that being pregnant is not considered a disability under ADA. However, is being immunocompromised considered a disability in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic? Is there any recourse that we can pursue?

In terms of your question, cdc guidelines have sort of fucked everyone.

","I'm not sure if my wife is aware of those recommendations - we will look into that. She has spoken to several OBGYNs on her unit, and they have given her different advice. Some say not to get the vaccine because there is no data, while others recommend getting it even though possible consequences to the fetus are unknown.

Edit: I just read the SMFM statement, and it recommends that the vaccine be made available to pregnant healthcare workers, and that the decision to be vaccinated be made in consultation with a healthcare provider. It doesn't specifically recommend that pregnant healthcare workers be vaccinated. 

This is very a very irritating situation because she is not needed on this assignment - there are plenty of low-risk nurses available at the hospital. Her management is putting us in a position to decide wether to risk Covid infection or risk unknown fetal consequences from the vaccine, for something that is not even part of her job. END"

","Yes but what I’m telling you is that in a pandemic as a nurse you do what you are told.  And the college of all the obgyns have said it’s okay and that’s what we base our actions on.  As a nurse I don’t care who’s pregnant or not, we have a duty to fulfill.  Plus there’s going to be Covid positive pregnant people to care for regardless.  So maybe just do your job and use the proper precautions because your wife is no more important than any other nurse pregnant or not...we all have families and loved ones we want to keep safe but we have no choice but to do our job.  There’s plenty of pregnant nurses already caring for Covid patients.  The best thing for you guys to do is to realize that no one wants to care for Covid patients but you aren’t more special than anyone else so do your job.  Here we have educators manning the swabbing stations.  They have no requirement for patient care but they still do it. END"
" Q: Coworker threatened to rape me, I'm being told to ignore it, we were both told not to interact anymore at work and not to discuss with anyone else.
T: GOOD
B: **Very very long story short a coworker called when I was out and said they would rape me if I had covid, I tried to brush it off as a “joke” but he reiterated that he would “sexually assault” me and even went as far as to say I’d need to go to the police. He claimed to be on specific pain meds at the beginning of the call for a health issue so I tried to brush it off as a joke while he was under the influence and really didn’t know what to do, but it continued to bother me. The more I thought about it the more I realized he had made multiple worrisome comments regarding other situations with sexual assault in his personal life as well as things that in hindsight seemed mildly threatening. Joke or not and regardless of meds it isn’t okay to say you’re going to rape or sexually assault someone ever, so a few days after I got back to work I reported it hoping we could sit down and discuss that it wasn’t okay at all and to hopefully make me feel more comfortable at work. 

I was interrogated with multiple witnesses on a few occasions after making my initial statement, as were a few coworkers that were aware of the situation because I was extremely upset and confided in them. The employer insinuated that it was not okay to discuss this with anyone but my boss during their questioning of me, as well as asking me if the aggressor seemed like the type of person would really assault me. In addition, many of their questions were extremely specific about who I had spoken to at what time and when and where I was throughout the days since, which I admitted to them my answers were not as specific and almost certainly missed details because I was extremely upset and growing more overwhelmed the longer this went on.

 Ultimately the mediation I had requested so that I could have some semblance of peace of mind or an apology because I was hoping he would do the right thing and admit it was a terrible mistake did not happen. Instead nothing was discussed and we were told not to interact in any way at work. We were also both given a few restrictions on where we were allowed to go at work and our interactions with others were both limited.

 Quite frankly the interactions they were limiting more seriously affected my day to day interactions with colleagues than his, because the place I am no longer allowed to go to discuss work projects he rarely sat at or sought information from. They said nothing in that moment about sexual assault not being tolerated or that he shouldn’t bother me outside of work, just that there is to be no contact while in the building. 

It feels like they’re covering for him while isolating me and I’m really worried about the security of my job for having sought help in this matter. I just want to feel safe and comfortable at work and this ordeal has been really bad for my mental health. In addition, I’m now worried that they made it seem like I somehow did something wrong in the handling of this?

 I love my job and am not trying to harm my employer in any way as it’s a family business and the family is truly wonderful, but I’m feeling really hurt by what has happened and I don’t know what to do. I’m also worried because my boss made a lot of statements to impress upon me that he didn’t seem to believe the guy would hurt me but what if he does? He clearly didn’t think about how hurtful it would be to say he would rape me so how am I to trust that it wouldn’t get worse even if he can’t contact me at work when the original incident happened when I wasn’t at work to begin with. I'm outside of Boston, MA. Please help.**

","OP:

In addition to what many of the other advise that is given, there is one more thing:  You need to document all of this down at home.

You need to put down, dates, times, faces, places, and who said what.  Everything you witnessed, everyone who was present, what all was said by who.

This is evidence that if something were to happen, it can be used to show intent, and if you have to take a legal means, it helps your lawyer out.  Also it preserves it in a snapshot of time, where even if you forget say a day later, a detail, it is there down in black and white.  

I would also advise that you keep documenting right now, for a few months.  Any and all interactions and other things that happen at your job, including any and all interactions with your supervisor and on up, along with any follow up with HR. It could be that HR is doing an investigation and can not tell you, so just keep an eye out and document. END"
" Q: New landlord delayed our move-in by over a month, then when he says we can finally move in, the apartment still needs repairs and cleaning
T: GOOD
B: We signed the lease back in July for a newly renovated unit. At this point we also paid them a large deposit, and first + last months rent. The lease says our move-in date is August 15th.  With little warning, the landlord continuously delayed this date by a few days, then a week, then two weeks, then almost 4 weeks. After receiving confirmation over email and over the phone that our unit would be ""all set"", we finally tried to move in yesterday (12th of September).  Only when we get there we find out from a builder that the unit still needed to have the microwave, sink, and bedroom windows replaced. Also, the entire place smelled and felt like a construction site, like it had been swept up but none of the floors or surfaces had been properly washed. The builder says they were storing all their tools and equipment in our unit during renovations of the other units, which I suspect is why it seemed so dusty.    


So obviously, the landlord has violated the terms of the lease and failed multiple times to live up to their promises. For us this is a red flag that we should have seen a long time ago, and we want out.  We want to terminate the lease and get all of our money back, but we're not sure if we really have grounds to take them to small claims court and both of us are nervous about getting involved with that on the chance that we can't get our money back and we go further into debt with the cost of legal help.

","Write your landlord a letter explaining that you are looking for an apartment somewhere else because the unit is not ready and it's been a month.  Ask for your deposit and first+last month's rent back.  You'll probably win in small claims court.  Your landlord broke the lease when the unit was not ready on 8/15.  The fact that you've been patient for a month doesn't nullify that.

By the way, where have you been staying during this month of uncertainty?  Your landlord is probably liable for your housing expenses during the month of delays. Of course, if you're staying with family for free, you probably just want your month's rent back. END"

","Not a lawyer. 
No one here knows what state you are in so they will only be able to offer general help.
Do you live near a law school? If so they might have have a legal clinic.
Legal aid is a good place to go as well.
You may also have a tenants association in your city or state that can help you.
you can google the bar association in your city/state and they can refer you to an attorney.

Don’t accept the keys or return the keys and be clear that you can not accept the apartment in that condition and that you believe they are in violation of their agreement. Next notify them that you are requesting your money back in full. You will probably have to give them a demand letter and you will need proof that it was delivered. How long they have to return your money depends on your state laws.

T: GOOD
B: After moving into my gf’s childhood home to help her father after her mother’s death (his wife) we spent four years living under his roof. Throughout those four years it became apparent that the dad is an extremely toxic human. 

We wanted to move out on year 3 as well as year 4 but he convinced my gf that he would sell us the house as it was hers. She bought the house in Feb. before the pandemic really took off. Living in lockdown with him became even more mentally taxing. Which led to an argument that lasted two days where the situation escalated and I was assaulted by the dad. All this occurred first week in June. 

Did not press charges or retain an PPO as it didn’t seem necessary. 

Sept 12th we had arranged for him to come to the house and retrieve the rest of his belongings. He was assisted by movers and several family members ( one of whom has stage four cancer and fosters 2 young girls), to take his things out of the house. At the time I was advised I shouldn’t be at the house to avoid any heated arguments. 

He proceeded to take the washer, dryer, couch, chair, which were items he had purchased but several of my belongings he took as well thinking they were his or out of spite.

" Q: Mercedes dealership drove my vehicle nearly 200 miles in one day for a “test drive”, Charlotte, NC
T: GOOD
B: Hi, I dropped my 2020 Mercedes off at a dealership (scheduled appointment) on Thursday night to have the touch screen repaired (it wouldn’t turn on). I was also getting an intermittent warning so the oil was over full. They told me they would likely do the repair Monday and gave me a loan vehicle. 

On Friday night at 7pm at closing, the service tech called my husband and asked permission to test drive the vehicle to the vicinity of Fort Mill, SC (about 15 mins away) and that they would do no more than max 100 miles.  My husband expressed concern at the 100 miles but agreed to the test drive so they could try and see the oil warning.

On Saturday morning,I woke up and GPS showed the car in York, at a house some 34 miles away. I decided to let this go for now, figuring if it returned to the dealership from there, they had added about 70 miles to the new car. 

However, on Saturday afternoon, the car started moving and ended up outside of Spartanburg, some 90 miles from the dealership, one way. While it was moving, I called the dealership and got ahold of the tech. He told me my husband gave him permission to test drive. I reminded him the drive was supposed to be Fort Mill and no more than 100 miles in the extreme end. Look, I tore him a new one to be honest. He finally admitted he let an employee take it home to use. I demanded the vehicle be returned immediately. It got back to the dealership around 10pm on Saturday night where it is locked and waiting repair now. 

It has 173 more miles on it. 

I have screen shots from its GPS. 

Plus they filled it, I have no idea with what kind of gas (I use supreme). I don’t know how it was driven, if it has stone chips, what gas was used, if any damage was done. 

The service tech offered to fully valet it as compensation. I know I can’t get the 173 miles off my odometer but a little wash is far from adequate. This was not a test drive but an employee flagrantly using my vehicle for the weekend. 

Where do I stand, what do I ask for as compensation, how do I know the vehicle was not thrashed while it was driven. What questions should I be asking, where do I even start please?

###

","He finally admitted he let an employee take it home to use.

This is the issue. How is the employee connected to diagnosing the issue. How was the employees use related to diagnosing it? Where are the employees notes to support he was in fact using the car to support diagnosing the issue.

If it were me, I would demand answers to those questions from the tech. Make sure it is recorded if it is verbal (be compliant with recording laws - if two party ask the tech if you can take notes).  After having the techs side of the story I would go to the service manager.   

If the employee used your car without having evidence that supports the use for the diagnosis, that is unauthorized use. I would not ask for service credits because I would take my service elsewhere.  How hard you push or forgive is a decision you will need to make. END"

I reminded him the drive was supposed to be Fort Mill and no more than 100 miles in the extreme end. Look, I tore him a new one to be honest. He finally admitted he let an employee take it home to use. I demanded the vehicle be returned immediately. It got back to the dealership around 10pm on Saturday night where it is locked and waiting repair now. 

It has 173 more miles on it. 

I have screen shots from its GPS. 

Plus they filled it, I have no idea with what kind of gas (I use supreme). I don’t know how it was driven, if it has stone chips, what gas was used, if any damage was done. 

The service tech offered to fully valet it as compensation. I know I can’t get the 173 miles off my odometer but a little wash is far from adequate. This was not a test drive but an employee flagrantly using my vehicle for the weekend. 

Where do I stand, what do I ask for as compensation, how do I know the vehicle was not thrashed while it was driven. What questions should I be asking, where do I even start please?

" Q: Man confronted me when delivering food to an apartment complex
T: GOOD
B: I’m a delivery driver in Texas and I was going to deliver food at this apartment complex. I notice this guy in a white car was chasing me and trying to get my attention. Turns out he’s super angry, asking me what my business there is. I tell him I’m a delivery driver and he yells “I don’t believe you, show me the food!” which I did. Then he tells me he’s seen me there before and security is looking for me and they’ll call the cops if they see me there again.

I think the guy was referring to a previous time when I delivered food there and sat in the parking lot til I got another order. I didn’t think I was hurting anything because there were tons of spots all around me. Also my car is a retired Crown Vic police car (no lights, sirens or anything that says police) so that may have had something to do with it. 

So is sitting in the apartment parking lot illegal? And how can I avoid conflicts like this in the future (besides getting a different car or repainting my current one)?

If he's some rando you can ignore him. If he works for the apartment complex you might be trespassing if you return. In that case you should complain in writing to the apartment complex and encourage the people you are delivering for to do so too. END"

","If you kill his dog your liability is limited to the replacement value of the dog, if you are completely in the wrong that is.

But as you have described it you are not in the wrong, at all, and you would likely owe nothing. Setting a dangerous dog on someone is assault almost everywhere, crossing into attempted murder in some instances. The only legal issue is whatever your chose to carry to defend yourself with.

Also you wouldn't owe anything until he sues your and (somehow) wins. Ignore any demands from him unless served a lawsuit.

That said, you should avoid this man if possible. A person who might set a dangerous dog on someone over this sort of this is clearly dangerous and unpredictable. END"

T: GOOD
B: I bought a new hot tub and arranged an electrician. He sent his son (not sure if he was licensed). I specially asked for a 60 amp breaker and told them it was a 3 wire install. They installed a 50 amp and hooked it up with 4 wires. They were looking at the wrong spot in the manual and also ignored a big orange sticker on the electrical board saying to NOT hook up 4 wires. The tub does not turn on and never did. The tub manufacturer said the incorrect install caused damage but won’t know how much until a tech comes out to evaluate and fix it. I told the electrician that I’d like the 60 amp breaker installed as I asked and that I would pay him once the repair cost is known. I agreed to pay the quoted amount minus the repair costs as his incorrect installation caused the damage.  I only asked that we wait until the tech can come out which is in a week. 

He is now calling and texting me multiple times a day calling me all kinds of names and being really aggressive.

" Q: Roommate forces me to keep paying rent
T: GOOD
B: Hey

I'm in a pretty tricky situation. I have a roommate that refuses to move out of an apartment with a lease that **expired** in August this year. I moved out myself, but they're forcing me to keep paying rent as they won't sign a form that releases me from the contract. To me it's weird how they have to ""release"" me, when the leasing period already finished.

On the lease it says that it *""shall commence until 08/31/2020, at which time thereafter shall become a month to month tenancy upon* ***written approval*** *of the landlord.""*,

so it clearly says that in order to extend the lease and pay monthly after expiration, you need a written approval of the landlord. I don't know if the remaining roommate applied for an extension of the lease, but if they did it was most certainly without my consent. I have NOT requested nor signed anything regarding prolonging the lease. To me, this sounds pretty illegal?

I have sent my 30 day notice of terminating, both emailed and called the office, but they simply tell me that in order for them to release me, my remaining roommate needs to fill in a release form and prove that they would be able to finance the rent themselves (which they refuse to do). Until then, the company claims that I'm obligated to keep paying rent.

&amp;#x200B;

I've moved to a new place I'm paying rent for, I cannot afford to pay to 2 rents and even if I did, I obviously don't want to. The remaining roommate isn't planning on leaving anytime soon, they're planning to keep chilling where they are, and have me pay part of the rent. Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to break free from this horrific situation? (The landlord couldn't care less and keeps telling me that in order for me to ""go"", **remaining tenant must release me from responsibility and income qualify on their own**)

###

","No, the leasing company is wrong.

Notice is effective if even one party gives it. And no renewal is effective without consent of the parties.

Yes, the lease converted to month-to-month if the landlord approved. But that’s irrelevant because you gave your notice.

Otherwise, if the landlord withheld consent, then the roommate still in the unit entered “holdover” (think unauthorized tenancy) but that would just be him. Holdover only applies to people still residing/possessing the property.

Your financial obligation ends at the later of the end of your original lease term or one month after you gave notice.

If they continue to misunderstand the situation, you can refuse payment. If they send to collections, you can force them to validate the debt. Ultimately, you can take it to court. END"

","Just break the lease and accept any early move out penalties by telling your landlord. Since the lease in month to month the most you owe is one month rent.

It shouldn’t even come to needing to do this clause since I’m pretty sure most states would consider the original lease expired and terminated if any one of the parties gives notice that they won’t be agreeing to a month to month lease, but even if it rolls over you can just break the month to month lease.

I (14m) live with my dad since forever, my mom abandoned us when I was a toddler and we haven't heard of her since. Better for us, I don't care and never did. 

My grandma (my father's mother) was always toxic with me as a kid with stuff like giving me lousy gifts and snarky remarks sometimes. Dad cut contact with her over an incident that I honestly didn't really cared (something about a house), I was only happy to get away from her. She always insulted me, and told me my mom was a who*e.

The thing is she contacted me though social media a couple of days ago and told me she had evidence to free my father from me by making the authorities take me away because my father isn't really mine. 
I took the bait and asked her what she meant and she said that she made a DNA test kit with me  a couple of years ago and when the results came back I didn't match with her so that means that I am not my father's son. I'm freaking out, I don't remember ever giving her any blood or something to make the test (I have no idea how those things work).

" Q: I got bit badly by a rescue dog
T: GOOD
B: I live in Chesapeake, Va. I was badly bitten on my neck by a dog we adopted and required about 30 stitches. For the back story, a couple posted the dog on a rehoming page because they said they couldn’t care for him any more. They said he was a good, well behaved dog that was great with older kids and cats. They disclosed that they adopted the dog from an animal rescue, and were under a contract with them, where if they couldn’t care for the dog, they would surrender him back to the rescue. The rescue told them that they did not have room for the dog, and told them to try to rehome him. We responded to the post about the dog and talked to the owner. We also talked to the animal rescue person about him, who said he was a really good dog and they never had any problems with him. The rescue person said we could sign a new adoption contract and adopt him if we wanted. We met the owners, the dog seemed really good, so we signed and brought him home. We had him for a week or so and everything was good. Thursday, my son was sitting on the couch with the dog. I kneeled down to pet the dog when he growled and lunged at my neck and tore it open. My 12 year old son witnessed the whole thing. My wife took me to the ER where they cleaned the bite and stitched it up. We contacted the rescue and told them what happened, and told them we have to surrender the dog. They told us they didn’t have room, and it would be up to us to rehome him again. They then went on to say that he must have done it because he was being protective of my son or because I was provoking him. We called city animal control and surrendered the dog to them. Because of the severity of the bite, they said he would be quarantined for 2 weeks. My wife did some poking around on the rescue’s website and found more information. About this dog. He bit a previous owner’s daughter in the face where she required stitches, which was not disclosed to us by the rescue. I apologize for the lengthy backstory, but wanted to try to get the facts in there. My questions are: What will happen if the rescue tries to sue us for breach of contract for not rehoming the dog? We did not feel safe with the dog in the house and immediately had animal control take him. My other question: Is the animal rescue negligent in not disclosing to us that this dog attacked someone before? He bit a teenaged girl and knew that we have a preteen son in the house.

I ignored this and told my niece to as well.

Well, we got a cat and somehow they found out and that group of five boys and three new girls were ringing my doorbell over and over and I literally wanted to freak out bc the way they rang my door bell was fucking ignorant. I answered my door they asked to see my cat I said no and to not come to my house again or ring my doorbell and shut my door.

They still continued to yell sexual things to me or my niece and the most fucked up thing happened I woke up from a nap around 6pm with rocks being thrown at my window, my doorbell being rung 30 times and when I got up the little girl was trying to pry open my living room window and one of the boys were trying to open my nieces window in the basement to make it worse there was the five boys the two girls and like three other new kids and my niece was just coming in and when they saw her they all ran away.

" Q: Fired for COVID-19? Is this legal? (South Dakota)
T: GOOD
B: I (M21) worked at a local tobacco and cigar shop since last November, and I really enjoyed it. Everything was great except the owner/manager. It wasn’t uncommon for him to show up in an awful mood and be an asshole to everybody(including customers at times.) Over the 8 months I worked there I had watched 10+ people get fired and so I always felt like I was walking on ice. We were all to work 7 days a week, and I was regularly doing ~60 hours a week. (I know this is fucked I just didn’t realize how bad it truly was.) I received 4 days off this year. Total.

Regardless, I worked my ass off because I loved the clientele and I learned everything about the business and soon I was manager. That is until about two weeks ago, I started feeling ill at work. The next day I felt worse and my girlfriend urged me to test for COVID, so I did. And it came back positive. The state department of health told me to quarantine for 10 days, you know the deal. So I called my boss and told him the results. 
He asked for my keys and said I was done. No explanation. Is this illegal? 
I also never received overtime pay. I know for a fact this is illegal. 
My question is: Is there anything i can use here to get the overtime money I was never paid? Or some sort of compensation for being fired for having COVID? This seems ridiculous. Any help would be appreciated guys, thanks.

TL;DR 
After 8 months of nearly no days off, lack of overtime pay, I was fired as manager for testing positive for COVID-19 and having to quarantine. What?!

" Q: My landlord says I'm not allowed to use the porch that exists only to get into my apartment
T: GOOD
B: So I'm renting an apartment in an old victorian house. The lady who owns it lives on the first floor and my apartment is in the back half of the second floor. The entrance to my apartment is an outside staircase in the back of the house and there's a small (3ftx 6ft) porch between the stairs and my door. Upon viewing the apartment I was told that the main front porch and back yard were not for my use, fine, but the little back porch was advertised as part of my apartment (obviously, it only exists to get to my door). 

I recently hung up a pride flag on my porch and very quickly got an email from my landlord saying that I need to take it down and I'm not allowed to use any outside space or have any outside decorations. There is no mention of outside space or decorations at all in my lease, I checked. I feel like I'm within my right to keep it up but I'm ok with taking it down to appease her. (and maybe hang it inside my storm door? That's technically inside)

But now she's saying that my front door porch is considered outside space therefore I can't use it even though the agent who showed the apartment said I could and there's no mention of it in the lease. I've been living here for 1.5 months and put a little chair and some twinkly lights and plants out there almost immediately. 

Legally, there's nothing stopping me from using my porch, right?

" Q: I’m believe I’m not being paid minimum wage for working hours. Oregon
T: GOOD
B: 
I work for a very large company here in Oregon in the health field.

I work on-call for them regularly, I am compensated at $3.00 an hour which is called, “stand-by time”. Where I wait and if a call comes in, I take it. 

I have to stay in the area, with my phone with me, I am not allowed to consume alcohol, and I have a time limit to return patient calls. 

During these calls I use my knowledge and work skills to assist patients, as well as triage whether or not I need to leave and assist them in person or if someone else needs to assist them. I use company programs and other information to come to these conclusions. 

I feel like during those time when I am on the phone, spending many hours of my weekend to assist people should be reimbursed at my regular rate, or at very least minimum wage. 

I am told that since I am not going to see the patients, that it is still considered, “stand by time” and I continue to be reimbursed at $3.00 an hour. So I could spend 3-4 hours of my day making and returning calls and not be able to take care of my personal errands, and I’m still only making $3.00 an hour.

My issue is I hold medical health licenses, and it seems like if Im having a conversation I could possibly be sued for, and I’m putting my licenses on the line, that I should receive appropriate compensation, not stand by time.  It isn’t  “standing by” if I’m engaged in trouble shooting. 

Can someone tell me if I’m correct, and how this should be handled?

###

","&gt; I have to stay in the area, with my phone with me, I am not allowed to consume alcohol, and I have a time limit to return patient calls.

How close do you have to stay, and what's the time limit?

When you actually return a call, are you paid your normal hourly rate for that period of time?

","Like jasperval says, you must be paid at least minimum wage during the actual calls themselves. And weighted overtime as appropriate

&gt; I have to stay within 30 minutes of the office, I have to return calls within 20 minutes

You're more likely ""waiting to be engaged"" (not work time) than ""engaged to wait"" (work time), so you don't have to be paid at all for the time you're just on call

" Q: Employer demanded to know my medication (Boston, MA)
T: GOOD
B: I was offered (and accepted) a  desk-research job at a major nonprofit in Boston. My on boarding paperwork included a form asking about major medical conditions and any medication I take. In writing, I communicated I did not want to disclose my medication, because they were related to a disability I have. I am bipolar and I take Seroquel. If you google the medication, you would know what I have. It is so well managed, you wouldn't know if I did not tell you.  But I have been treated terribly in the past because of my diagnosis.

 In my on boarding meeting, they insisted that I disclose my medication, and then asked me why I take it. After learning I am bipolar, they told me they need a letter from my psychiatrist stating I am ""fit to work"" as a bipolar person. I have been doing this job in basically a contracting role for 2 years. They know I can do this job.  

Is it legal to:

* Demand to know what medications employees take
* Demand to know why they take their medications
* Demand individuals with disabilities submit verification from their doctors about their ""fittness"" to work

In previous jobs I have been asked whether I take any medication or have any conditions that would interfere with my job, and what accommodations I might need if so. That doesn't bother me. I am distressed that my employer demanded to know my personal medical information, and that they used that information to question my capabilities. 

To be clear, I don't want to sue my employer. I don't know if what they did was illegal or just inappropriate. I want them to change their on boarding procedure to be less invasive. I want to ensure that individuals with disabilities feel welcome and respected at or organization. And, I want an apology from the person who on boarded me. What are my best steps forward from here?

I tried calling the EEOC and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination to ask these questions, but wasn't able to get through to a person.

","NAL but a bipolar person. This is basically an ADA violation. Unless your having issues at work (due to medications or side effects in which case disclosure may be necessary if they were to suddenly want you to drink a forklift and your on certain meds etc) or there is a very specific risk of certain types of medicines and your environment (in which case they should disclose the risks and what specific types of meds would be affected and NOT require you to disclose what you take only IF you were on something) this is basically BS. The only reason that they would ever need a doctors note from a psychiatrist would be IF something very specific happened at work that required medical attention and you were deemed medically unfit for a period- that have no right to demand this, it’s discrimination.
Get in touch with ADA ASAP and make sure to document everything. There’s a high chance they may try retribution or firing you or pushing you to quit as a result of your ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST DUE TO A MEDICAL CONDITION.
You need to get everything you possibly can together and speak to someone soon. They can advocate on your behalf. END"

T: BAD
B: Here is the message that I would send:

Hey! So I put a few things together for anyone working or has worked at [company name] to hopefully help you out if you were wronged there. This is being sent to numerous people with different positions and circumstances so not everything here will apply to you. My intent here is to provide you with the information to file a complaint if you feel the need to do so, and so you can get compensated for any wage loss if you'd like to.

For any tipped employees that had to clock out prior to rolling silverware while waiting for your paperwork to finish, this is highly illegal. Even if it's only 10 minutes a day, that can add up to a full paycheck or more a year.
Law: https://apps.azsos.gov/public_services/Title_20/20-05.pdf

Form to file complaint: https://www.azica.gov/forms/labor3303

[company name] required employees to provide a doctors note to claim any sick pay, this is also illegal in AZ unless you miss 3 or more consecutive days. Otherwise employers must pay you for your days missed so as long as you contacted your supervisor. They are not allowed to request a doctors note. 
Law:
https://www.azica.gov/labor-frequently-asked-questions-english
Scroll down to earned paid sick leave and read ""Can an employer require employees to document absences in which earned paid sick time was used?""
If this happened to you and you were not paid, you can fill out form: https://www.azica.gov/forms/labor3305
You can be compensated for any days missed that you were not paid for as long as you have or had the sick time available

Another big issue at GCB was not getting proper over time payment (only for hourly employees). I know [owners name] regularly did not pay OT, only straight time instead of time and a half. Also very illegal on the federal level. 
You can be compensated for this! Since it is a federal law, you would need to call the local department of labor office in Phoenix 602-514-7100 or 1-866-487-9243. There are no forms for this, you would just give the information requested to who you speak with.

","  Sadly if you still work there and want to keep your job I would say a big NO to this.  I don't want to but sadly most of the USA workers are ""at-will"" and they can turn around and fire you for ALMOST any reason and only if you have absolute proof that it was for an illegal one do you have hope.

  I think that the whole At-Will work thing is ripe for corruption and needs to be abolished.  However I have not looked into this a lot so I do not know everything and am open to education on it and it's benefits vs problems.

I went with the dealer financing, signed the papers, picked up the car two days later, and thought that was it. On Tues, June 9, the dealer left me a voicemail saying the dealer financing was not approved at the rate they gave me and I need to come in and sign a paper to use my bank financing at the higher APR. I did some research it seemed like they were in violation of the Bushing Laws in WA State since they would only have 4 business days to let me know this and it had been seven. So I sent the dealer an email saying they need to honor the original APR and they said that Bushing Laws do not require them to buy the loan at the original rate, and my options were to put more money down or look for another loan.   


Is the dealer obliged to honor the original APR? Can I return the vehicle if they don't? Is the contract voided if I don't sign the new papers?

","Honestly, this is something you'll find in more then  just this dealership. Sometimes it's a scam, sometimes it's them trying to recoup their own loses. Sometimes it's a genuine mistake

one of the fun solutions I've seen is take the keys and the contract with you to see them in person. Tell them that they can either respect the contract they already have, or they can undo the deal and take back the car with whatever mileage you put on it, WITHOUT taking cash for wear/tear. either they back down and agree or you get your money.

It was a scandal for a couple months, but the guy is extremely well connected with local pd, rich, and white. Despite testimonials the police never even talked to the kid, only his dad and fancy lawyer of course. The guy ended up getting a full ride scholarship to a respectable college and of course no charges got pressed.

Anyways fast-forward a bit and it got brought up on twitter by some other people (it’s pretty well known what happened in the town) and my girlfriend ended up contacting the guys colleges coaches and letting them know what happened, as well as sending a tweet calling the guy “disgusting,” etc.


Yesterday she got a very threatening email from the boys dad asking for a written formal apology along with publicly retracted statements, after which the dad “might” decide to not press charges for defamation of character. Keep in mind my girlfriend is 20 with very little resources and this is a rich family who is very well connected to the local police department. The boy has been “exhonorated” by the police report (in which they didn’t even speak with him) but everyone knows what really happened, especially the girls that had pictures of them sold and the people he was trying to sell it to. But either way I know the chance of reopening the case and winning against him is zero to none, but...

What are our options here? I hate to see this type of injustice but I know the reality that many court cases ultimately boil down to who can afford a better lawyer. Does  she have no choice but to retract her statements and just pray she doesn’t get sued? And what are the potential outcomes in case she does get sued, would she lose a ton of money or potentially face charges on her record? 

Neither of us have any experience with these sorts of things so we seriously appreciate it.

","One of the main things the court looks for when dealing with defamation is if the person making (publisher) the statement knew that the statement was false, but published it anyway. In your hypo, saying “actionhero was investigated by the police for the mysterious death of his wife”, if you had in fact been investigated, wouldn’t be untruthful. Saying “actionhero killed his wife” or even “in my opinion, actionhero killed his wife” would open them to liability if the statement was unfounded or untrue. Another issue is whether the person believed the statement, or if they had serious doubts about the truth of the matter and said it anyway. Yet another component is whether the person saying that to your employer was negligent in the sense that they didn’t try to find out if the statement was true before saying it... as in “I heard that actionhero killed his wife”. It sounds like the OP’s girlfriend believes what she is saying to be true. If I were her, I’d stick to stating the facts (he was investigated for XYZ”) instead of the more risky “he did XYZ”, because then she’ll need to demonstrate why she believes that to be true and what she’s basin that belief on.

","You don't list your location, but generally, defamation isn't a criminal matter. Harassment can be a criminal charge, however. She can be sued for civil damages (as in monetary damages) for defamation and harassment. Truth is a defense to defamation but the issue is proving that it's the truth. Does she have evidence he did this? Going beyond that though, even if it is true, that isn't necessarily a defense for her using that information to harass him. If he can prove her actions caused him some kind of harm, he may potentially be able to get a judgment against her. While she might be judgment proof now, judgments can last several years and can make it difficult to do things like get loans or apply for credit.

","What state are you in?

Generally, truth is an absolute defense against claims of defamation (libel or slander). From what you said, your girlfriend contacted the coaches and told them **about the charges** that ended up getting dismissed. Simply notifying a person and telling them that someone else has had criminal charges brought against them doesn’t rise to the level of defamation, because it’s both factual and a part of the public record. This is no different than an employer doing a background check to determine an applicant’s arrest history. However, she may be open to liability if she contacted the coaches to say that he actually did sell kiddy porn, since the matter has already been adjudicated.

" Q: Invested in a house with ex and his parents that the ex and I lived in. He cheated (again), I left. They sold the house, gave me nothing and used the profits to buy him a different house.
T: BAD
B: When my ex and I moved in together for the first time (after dating over 6 years), our credit was not good. His parents got a loan in their name to purchase a home, we put in all the money. Nothing was put into writing prior to the deal. Ex put in $17,000 and I put in $7,000 towards the down payment and other expenses (inspections, earnest money, etc). I paid the mortgage every month we lived there (@$13,000). I painted, purchased light fixtures and assisted in every step of the process when fixing up the house. Bought the house at $140,000. When the house sold, we owed $122,000 and they sold the house for $160,000. 

I got an email from the ex’s mom prior to sale price going public saying they took a loss and NO ONE was getting anything back. They claimed they had put in $12,000 (which is false) and they were losing all of their money, the ex was losing all his money and so was I. Made me giggle, at the end of that email, she forgot to delete a sentence from her draft saying “you will get a $1,000 and nothing more”. I got zero as they clearly changed their minds. Turns out, I was the only one who lost all my money because they took all profits from the sale of our home and used it as a down payment for a new house for him. Mommy and daddy co-signed and bailed out their abusive cheating alcoholic son yet again.... from day 1, the ex has lied, said he got nothing and is renting his current house. All lies.

I have emails where she admits they were not supposed to put in any money, that the house was theirs in name only. She made up “charges” that I owe them like disposal of a piano I left at the house - the ex just admitted to keeping it as a “project”. I have receipts and cancelled checks, the mortgage company understood the arrangement as did the initial realtor. Taking into account there was no contract between us, do I have any legal recourse? In addition to the email where she (generally) admits the arrangement, I believe there is a good chance I could get the real estate agent to attest to my version of the events. 

Side notes - not sure any of this matters but, some additional detail... my new job had paid a total of $50,000 for me to move and that included paying the portion of my previous mortgage that was upside down. The reason I left was he was an alcoholic and the relationship got progressively abusive. he was a serial cheater and I moved out specifically when I found out he slept with his coworker while we were living together (again, this was ongoing) in the parking lot outside the building they worked in. Despite everything, I was trying to be fair and only asked for $4,000 from the sale which was 1/3 of what I believed the profits to be AFTER the ex and his parents got their money back first - i wasn’t even including my initial $7,000 investment. They sold the house because the ex could not afford the $1,100/month mortgage. After I moved out, mommy and daddy paid the mortgage for him because he couldn’t. 

I think you can gather from my post - I’m bitter.

I would try to sue them in small claims court.  
If your lose is over the small claims amount then you have to talk to a lawyer to see if you should go to regular court.  

You are entitled to the $7K initial investment if it was not a gift.   
Where it gets muddy is trying to sue for the mortgage payments and a share of the profit.  You may not be able to win a case for those, but  you should be successful suing for your down payment back. END"
" Q: Invested in a house with ex and his parents that the ex and I lived in. He cheated (again), I left. They sold the house, gave me nothing and used the profits to buy him a different house.
T: BAD
B: When my ex and I moved in together for the first time (after dating over 6 years), our credit was not good. His parents got a loan in their name to purchase a home, we put in all the money. Nothing was put into writing prior to the deal. Ex put in $17,000 and I put in $7,000 towards the down payment and other expenses (inspections, earnest money, etc). I paid the mortgage every month we lived there (@$13,000). I painted, purchased light fixtures and assisted in every step of the process when fixing up the house. Bought the house at $140,000. When the house sold, we owed $122,000 and they sold the house for $160,000. 

I got an email from the ex’s mom prior to sale price going public saying they took a loss and NO ONE was getting anything back. They claimed they had put in $12,000 (which is false) and they were losing all of their money, the ex was losing all his money and so was I. Made me giggle, at the end of that email, she forgot to delete a sentence from her draft saying “you will get a $1,000 and nothing more”. I got zero as they clearly changed their minds. Turns out, I was the only one who lost all my money because they took all profits from the sale of our home and used it as a down payment for a new house for him. Mommy and daddy co-signed and bailed out their abusive cheating alcoholic son yet again.... from day 1, the ex has lied, said he got nothing and is renting his current house. All lies.

I have emails where she admits they were not supposed to put in any money, that the house was theirs in name only. She made up “charges” that I owe them like disposal of a piano I left at the house - the ex just admitted to keeping it as a “project”. I have receipts and cancelled checks, the mortgage company understood the arrangement as did the initial realtor. Taking into account there was no contract between us, do I have any legal recourse? In addition to the email where she (generally) admits the arrangement, I believe there is a good chance I could get the real estate agent to attest to my version of the events. 

Side notes - not sure any of this matters but, some additional detail... my new job had paid a total of $50,000 for me to move and that included paying the portion of my previous mortgage that was upside down. The reason I left was he was an alcoholic and the relationship got progressively abusive. he was a serial cheater and I moved out specifically when I found out he slept with his coworker while we were living together (again, this was ongoing) in the parking lot outside the building they worked in. Despite everything, I was trying to be fair and only asked for $4,000 from the sale which was 1/3 of what I believed the profits to be AFTER the ex and his parents got their money back first - i wasn’t even including my initial $7,000 investment. They sold the house because the ex could not afford the $1,100/month mortgage. After I moved out, mommy and daddy paid the mortgage for him because he couldn’t. 

I think you can gather from my post - I’m bitter. I’m pissed that he cheats, takes the money and now owns a home when I had to take a loan off my retirement to be able to get a security deposit so I could rent a place for my kids and i. Honestly, I don’t need their money, it not even about that anymore - I want vindication that I am not crazy - I need someone else to see through their lies and gaslighting.

" Q: In need of help-- 17F being forced to stay with my dad for a month due to court order, the judge refuses to listen to me or my little brother (14) and is doing everything in favor of my dad. (Colorado)
T: GOOD
B: Sorry for the long post, Tl;dr at the bottom. I'm also on mobile.

My parents divorced 2-3 years ago, and it was a pretty nasty and stressful divorce.

My dad is verbally abusive and has been physically and (I hope only just to me, it would be torture to me if he had done this to my brothers) sexually abusive in the past. Despite the efforts of me and my little brother sending multiple letters to the judge and begging my mom constantly to fight harder for us to stop going to his house, the judge that works on the case keeps filing in my dad's favor. According to my mom, he yelled at her in court and told her she was stupid for filing to restrict parenting time against my dad, which she had done because and my younger brother and I requested it.

My dad has been lying in court, saying that my younger brother and I love it at his house, and we're always excited to go. However, my dad refuses to get us basic everyday necessities (toiletries, clothes, etc.) that he has been court-ordered to get for us. He also ignores us all the time and provides no entertainment. 

A couple of weeks ago, he made us go over to his house for the weekend, and alas he ignored us again. I was stressed the entire weekend, and when I found out that he was making no plans to return us to our mom, I flipped. He had told the police (who had followed my mom to his house) that he wasn't planning on returning us to the 15th, and my mom hadn't been replying to his messages so he just went through with it without asking for an agreement. 

I became overly stressed because I never even wanted to be there in the first place, and there was some yelling back and forth. It ended while my dad was on the phone with the police, and my dad pushed me into a flight of stairs and threw a bucket that originally had my stuff in it at me. He was holding me down, and when he had pulled back his fist like he was going to punch me, I pushed him away with my feet. He told the police that I had assaulted him, and he wanted to press charges to throw me in jail. I had a panic attack in my room from the stress. Police didn't press charges, but he had to return me to my mom's house until the next court date, which was yesterday.

The court is giving him a month of ""makeup time"" starting today and made an order saying that my brother and I are not allowed to testify in court.

The cops have also told me to stop calling them because they think that it's a waste of their time.

I'm afraid that my father is going to harm me and my little brother and make efforts to keep us away from our mom as long as possible. He also says rude things about my mom almost all the time, and I don't want him to alienate my little brother.

What can I, a 17-year-old, do?


Tl;dr: A family court judge has put me and my brother in a situation where we're staying with my abusive father for a month and refuses to listen to us.

T: BAD
B: So I am an international student currently living in DC. I had planned to return home right after my graduation in May but got stuck in the US due to the coronavirus lockdown, but I hope to leave as soon as possible by July or august at the latest. 

My university campus shut down in March, and because I couldn’t go home, I moved into a short term sublet until I can return home. Basically, I am living out of boxes and suitcases and have no desire of unpacking or settling down at this house, I just want to go home as soon as I can. Enter my housemate. Last week, she told me that she was missing several items of clothing and some jewelry and thought that I had taken them. She asked to search my room alone, open my boxes, suitcases, etc. I refused because a) she isn’t my landlord, b) I felt that I had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and c) she couldn’t even give me an exact inventory of the things I supposedly stole. Things were fine, if awkward, until yesterday, when she entered my room without my permission while I wasn’t there and tried to search through my things. I caught her and told her in no uncertain terms to stay out. Now she says she will call the police if I don’t consent to a search of everything I have so she can ensure I haven’t stolen from her. 

I am totally at my wits end. There’s no way to lock my room door, but I’m resorting to transferring my valuables into my suitcases and putting mini locks on them. I am looking for flights out of here now because this is really not a problem I needed. What should I do? Should I let her search through my things? Does she have any standing to call the police? If she does, should I let them search through my things? What if she claims something of mine is hers? Any advice more than appreciated!

" Q: [Fort Thomas, KY] Did a property survey and explained my plans to my neighbor about installing a privacy fence. May be getting into a property line dispute. What are the laws surrounding easements I need to worry about (if any) and what are my rights regarding trees bordering our properties?
T: GOOD
B: I purchased a home in Fort Thomas, KY (located in Campbell County) last year and this summer we plan to install a privacy fence surrounding our property (I checked and privacy fences are permitted by our local laws). The previous owners had a fence, but the rear portion did not extend across the very back of the property and instead stopped some 20-30 feet away.

We had a property survey done to determine where the back property line was (since the old fence didn't run along it) and learned that our property extends back farther than we originally thought. The neighbors behind us, who have lived in their home for about six years, were surprised as well, and are now raising concerns about our plans to install the new fence.

There are two specific concerns that the neighbor has raised.

* Our property line sits four feet from their concrete driveway. When discussing the matter with our neighbor he brought up something which he termed ""easement to an existing structure"" (a term I'd never heard) and claimed that since his driveway is a structure which existed prior to my plan to install this fence, there are laws/ordinances pertaining to the distance any structure I build must be from his existing structure. I couldn't find much online about this term, but it's possible I don't have the right legal vocabulary to search properly. When it comes to property lines, is there an easement I need to be concerned about and, if so, what? I checked my Warranty Deed and it states ""The subject property is subject to easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions of record and/or in existence."" How do I determine what these might be?


* Along the whole back portion of my property, including along the property line, is much foliage. In particular along the property line, there is a lot of overgrown honeysuckle and other smallish trees that kind of form a green privacy barrier of sorts between us. In order to install the new fence, much of this foliage needs to be cleared. My question is about what I am allowed to clear. I've heard that if a tree is on my neighbor's side but branches of it extend over to my side, I am allowed to trim those branches back. Is that true? And what about trees that sit directly on the property line? Who is allowed to do what with them? I really don't want to remove something I'm not legally allowed to and have my neighbor get more upset.


When Monday rolls around I plan to engage the local government in some way to learn more, but in the meantime I thought I'd get a head start and see if anyone here knows anything or has had similar experiences. Thank you.

","NAL, but I've worked in the field with several cases dealing with easements like this.

My two cents is this -- you're definitely going to need a lawyer (self-help is out of the question), and the costs you can expect will be $3000 at the lowest (assuming the neighbors and their lawyer are cooperative) to $5-30k if the neighbors put up a fight, or even up to hundreds of thousands if it went as far as litigation.

Considering that the neighbors may potentially have that ""easement to an existing structure"" (I have absolutely no clue on the merits of this, but let's assume it is valid) it may turn out to actually benefit you in a way -- because both of you have each something to give and something to take, it's quite likely the attorneys could agree to simply give your few feet closest to their driveway in exchange for you getting the larger area of land.

Bottom line, no matter who is really legally int eh right or not, both parties can sue over this if they want, and oftentimes they'll do it not just cause they think they'll win, but because it raises the ante in terms of legal fees -- it says ""I'm willing to dig my heels in and spend a ton of money on litigation -- are you?"".  And even though there's laws against frivolous lawsuits like that, you have to fight the whole case first, win, and then take up that issue -- which is such a heavy burden itself that you'd likely just want to settle fast like they wanted you to.  Considering this all, I think the lawyers would be highly inclined to both avoid litigation and each concede something, even if it's imbalanced, simply because both sides would be getting something and because litigation would be extremely expensive with very little to gain that you couldn't with simple negotiations.  Just try to find yourself a transactional real estate attorney first rather than a litigator. END"

The neighbors behind us, who have lived in their home for about six years, were surprised as well, and are now raising concerns about our plans to install the new fence.

There are two specific concerns that the neighbor has raised.

* Our property line sits four feet from their concrete driveway. When discussing the matter with our neighbor he brought up something which he termed ""easement to an existing structure"" (a term I'd never heard) and claimed that since his driveway is a structure which existed prior to my plan to install this fence, there are laws/ordinances pertaining to the distance any structure I build must be from his existing structure. I couldn't find much online about this term, but it's possible I don't have the right legal vocabulary to search properly. When it comes to property lines, is there an easement I need to be concerned about and, if so, what? I checked my Warranty Deed and it states ""The subject property is subject to easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions of record and/or in existence."" How do I determine what these might be?


* Along the whole back portion of my property, including along the property line, is much foliage. In particular along the property line, there is a lot of overgrown honeysuckle and other smallish trees that kind of form a green privacy barrier of sorts between us. In order to install the new fence, much of this foliage needs to be cleared. My question is about what I am allowed to clear. I've heard that if a tree is on my neighbor's side but branches of it extend over to my side, I am allowed to trim those branches back. Is that true? And what about trees that sit directly on the property line? Who is allowed to do what with them? I really don't want to remove something I'm not legally allowed to and have my neighbor get more upset.


When Monday rolls around I plan to engage the local government in some way to learn more, but in the meantime I thought I'd get a head start and see if anyone here knows anything or has had similar experiences. Thank you.

","Your best bet is to find the local ordinances. What do they say about building fences? Is there a distance they need to be from the property line? Is there a distance they have to be from a structure. Does a driveway count as a structure?

I found Fort Thomas's ordanices online after a quick google search:

http://ftthomas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2012-Zoning-Ordinance.pdf

http://ftthomas.org/general-services/zoning-ordinance/

They're long and extensive, just do a search for fences. I didn't see anything about ""easement of existing structure."" If you *really* want to get the go ahead on the fence, spend a couple hundred bucks on a real estate lawyer to give you what you really need. END"

T: GOOD
B: She is in a relationship with someone who grabs, chokes, slaps, and slams her into walls. Growing up with her I can tell you she is the most timid and kind person in the world. She was always shy and quite. She has been enduring this for years without telling anyone but I saw bruises on her side when she reached to get something out of a cupboard and asked her what happened and she started crying and wouldn't talk to me about it. Finally she told me about all the abuse she has been getting when we were away from the house alone.

She is broke. She has no money and his family has money and connections in the town. She is afraid that even if she did try to get a divorce the she would be going up against someone who has a good lawyer and she would be left to defend herself.

Details:

1. She found installed a smart camera wall outlet wifi device.
2. He has complete control over her phone and he connects Bluetooth devices or somehow is able to listen to her calls because she said he has mentioned things that she talked about away from him on the phone and she heard herself come over a speaker in their house one time.
3. He started asking her a year ago to get life insurance. What the fuck? She said that he has been asking her nonstop every couple of weeks saying they need to get life insurance.
4. He has their home computer encrypted so only he can log into it.
5. He installed something behind the drywall in their house. I know it sounds crazy but she showed me the wall outlet cameras so I know she is not exaggerating.
6. He is openly admitting that he cheats on her.
7. They live in Illinois where I thought it was illegal to record someone else?
8. They have a son that is 1.
9. The abuse really kicked up when he lost his job due to covid and he is at home all the time now.
10. They have one vehicle.
11. They are both signed on the vehicle and home mortgage.
12. She pays all of the house payments.
13. For some reason he bought smart wifi light bulbs but didn't install them anywhere that she found. Does anyone know what they could be used for? maybe for their connectivity and as switches?
14. She is working part time and all that money goes towards paying for the mortgage.
15. Out parents have passed and no one has much money on our side of the family to help her.

","Not a lawyer, am a social worker. 

Generally leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous part of the relationship. The abuse CANNOT know she is thinking about leaving. 

She needs to get legal representation for the divorce. Local domestic violence groups can help her. That lawyer can help her with legal stuff like restraining orders, custody, and the divorce. DV groups may have a low cost or free lawyer program. 

Here’s my social work, practical advice (not strictly legal but important)

Calling the DV groups on her phone could be dangerous, so she should not call on any phone to which he has access. I know you said your family doesn’t have a lot of money. If you and your family can pull together ~$50 you should be able to get her a cheap prepaid phone and a nicer phone for more money. This phone should not be anywhere he can find it. See if she can leave it at work or you can get it or something. When she leaves she should leave her current phone at their home. Have her send anything important to the cloud or you if it is safe. 

Someone will need to find her a place to go. Domestic Violence Shelters will keep her safe and are fairly restrictive out of necessity. If she does not want to go to a shelter and goes to a friends or family members home that he knows about she and the people she is staying with could be in danger. The best thing is for her to go to a place that he doesn’t know about. Maybe a new apartment or a friend of the family. 

Any documentation of the abuse could prove helpful in getting a restraining order and to keep custody after the divorce. She can take pictures on a phone he cannot access. Have them sent to you or backed up on the cloud. Pictures of any cameras that she can safely get. Pictures on her second phone of texts and emails. 

She will need her and her child’s legal documents eventually. IF she can get them out of the home and to a safe person safely she should do so. This likely means taking them with them when she leaves. If she can’t do that but has pictures of the documents that’s fine for right now. If she can’t do this her life is more important. After she leaves she will need to lock her credit there is a sticky on r/personalfinance that talks about that more. 

She likely won’t have access to their money once she leaves. If she has a personal account she can move that money when she is in a safe place. She should be able to call the institution and lock down that money when she leaves. 

She and the child will need to leave when he is away. She may have no time so getting a small supply of things at your home or another trusted persons home that can be brought to her wherever will be helpful. Think shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, tampons, hair brush, clothes, and diapers. 

Some states and cities have domestic violence leave for someone leaving a DV situation. If she has that, great! Use it. If not going to work can be dangerous and she should arraigned for some time off, WFH, or a transfer to a different location. 

He may have trackers on the car, in any case he will likely be able to recognize the car, so she should leave it or hide it away from where she is staying. 

Her safety is the priority here and this is fairy general advice. Someone who works for a DV group can provide more specifics. 

Domestic Violence hotlines are not only for the person being abused. You can call and get more loca guidance for her. They may have funds and items available since leaving is expensive. To get connected you can use google or call the United Way’s 211

Edited to Add:
Police may help but they may put her in more danger if they don’t arrest. If they come she and the child should leave with them. 

Illinois does have DV leave under the Victims Economic Security and Safety Act. She can get 12 total weeks of unpaid leave every 12 months. END"

","Typically this falls under who ever enforces your municipalities storm water management plan. Where i live our ordinance states any knowing discharge of nonstormwater is a violation. The exception is residential and charity carwashes, irrigation, and agriculture. TCEQ can also be directly reported too, and they will refer it to the local department. For your part I would try to get visual evidence of the discharge occurring.

" Q: Concrete truck ripped out electrical line and caused $1,800 worth of damage, refusing to pay
T: GOOD
B: Hello all, lets set up some background info on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tennessee, USA

The house is 70 years old.

I live on a dead end street, towards the end.

My wife and I are renting this house from my father-in-law.

He didnt tell the homeowners insurance company that we are renting so we were denied the claim from them.

&amp;#x200B;

December of 2019

EPB (my electrical provider) came out to my house to replace the meter face with a new one. The guy that came out notified me that a small C-clamp that was holding the meter to the exterior wall of my house had worked it way out and was needing to be re-attached before he could swap meters. I had thought about doing this myself, but im not an electrician and dont want to kill myself. It never got replaced, meter or clamp, due to financial issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to April 4, 2020

My neighbor across the street had some plumbing work done to their house and the plumbing company had sourced Sequatchie Concrete Company to fill in some areas that need concrete. So the large concrete mixer truck came down my dead end street, poured the mixture and left. 

As the concrete truck left, the top of the truck snagged my electrical line and proceeded to rip off the meter center from my house. The plumbers were still on site and tried to wave the truck down but to no avail. I filed a police report for hit and run property damage and called EPB. They came out , said they could not re-attach the line because the meter and subsequent interior lines were potentially damaged.  They disconnected the electrical line and left. My wife and i moved all of our fridge food to my parents house and crashed with them for 4 days until we found enough money for the electrician to come out and he could fix it. $1,800 later, we were back in our home.

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/lWmUcK2)

Now Sequatchie is saying that because the line was mounted too low, was not up to code, and was previously damaged (missing the c-clamp) they are not to be held responsible for this. I just dont believe this to be true. At the end of the day, it was their truck that damaged my home. EPB has sent me a letter of denial saying it was not their fault and i am expecting one from Sequatchie as well soon.

My husband just got off the phone with his dad where he learned that the family dog had been put down. Although old, she was still healthy, walked with a bit of a limp, and had no major health concerns that would require euthanasia. MiL waited until he was at work, snuck the dog off to ""a friend of hers who works at a vet"" and had the dog put down.

She's never liked the dog as it's a reminder of dad's past marriage, and this is far from the craziest thing she's done, but I'm honestly at a loss as to whether we can do anything about her effectively stealing the dog away to have it killed. The dog was licensed in dad's name, and has been in the family longer than MiL has. It was the last connection my husband and his sister had to their mother, who passed away a decade ago.

Any advice on what we could do would be greatly appreciated.

" Q: Is my neighbor committing mail fraud by returning my mail without my consent?
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway out of fear of retaliation, Maryland resident. This is a complex situation so bear with me, TLDR at bottom.

My boyfriend and I rent an in-law apartment above a garage that is in the backyard of my landlords house. He signed the lease alone before we met, I held on to my lease in another city but when I got a job close to his apartment, we basically started living together. The super chill landlord amended the lease to acknowledge that I reside here and raised the rent $50 a month without making me sign the lease. 

The problem is that the super chill landlord is married to a decidedly unchill woman. I will not go into detail about some of the things she’s done, but it’s very clear that her actions are malicious and deliberate. 

She took our landlord to court and had him removed from the home. She wanted both of us to sign a new lease with her, but my boyfriend refused to be her tenant. We checked the court order and confirmed with landlord and landlords lawyer that despite his absence, he is still the owner of the property, so boyfriend signed a new lease with him. After my other lease ended, I signed the lease here so I am now a legal resident here. Just to give you a sense of this woman, after she found out that he had signed a lease with landlord and not her, she turned our hot water heater down which was behind a locked door that we didn’t have the key to, and wouldn’t fix it until the landlord told her that she was interfering with our tenants rights.

We have no legal obligation to his wife. However, we share certain county amenities, such as garbage cans and a mailbox. My shipping address for deliveries has been [boyfriend FN - my initials - boyfriend LN] to ensure she wouldn’t mess with my mail before I was on the lease. She has previously held onto our mail or packages without letting us know that they’re here and/or left them outside in the rain to be destroyed. 

A few weeks ago, I noticed that an order I had made for clothes had been refunded because it had been returned to sender due to address issues. I wrote it off as a one off USPS mistake and didn’t follow up or reorder because it wasn’t an essential purchase. I bought new glasses, I have awful eyesight, that wouldn’t interfere with my mask as my job is starting to open up. As far as I knew, they were scheduled to be delivered today. Apparently, they were delivered on Wednesday to the mailbox and returned to sender on Thursday. I saw her both Wednesday and Thursday and she said nothing to me. 

I have other medical devices being shipped, and have not received any mail here other than my official change of address, which was pulp because the rain destroyed it, because she took it out of the mailbox and left it in the rain on her porch. I am confident she is doing this intentionally to me. 

Is this a crime? What should I do? How can I protect my mail if it gets put in a shared mailbox that she gets ring alerts to and we don’t? Help please.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that an order I had made for clothes had been refunded because it had been returned to sender due to address issues. I wrote it off as a one off USPS mistake and didn’t follow up or reorder because it wasn’t an essential purchase. I bought new glasses, I have awful eyesight, that wouldn’t interfere with my mask as my job is starting to open up. As far as I knew, they were scheduled to be delivered today. Apparently, they were delivered on Wednesday to the mailbox and returned to sender on Thursday. I saw her both Wednesday and Thursday and she said nothing to me. 

I have other medical devices being shipped, and have not received any mail here other than my official change of address, which was pulp because the rain destroyed it, because she took it out of the mailbox and left it in the rain on her porch. I am confident she is doing this intentionally to me. 

Is this a crime? What should I do? How can I protect my mail if it gets put in a shared mailbox that she gets ring alerts to and we don’t? Help please.

TLDR; Share mailbox with Landlord’s estranged wife, she is returning my mail without my consent or alerting me of its arrival. Want to know what my legal rights are.

" Q: Is my neighbor committing mail fraud by returning my mail without my consent?
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway out of fear of retaliation, Maryland resident. This is a complex situation so bear with me, TLDR at bottom.

My boyfriend and I rent an in-law apartment above a garage that is in the backyard of my landlords house. He signed the lease alone before we met, I held on to my lease in another city but when I got a job close to his apartment, we basically started living together. The super chill landlord amended the lease to acknowledge that I reside here and raised the rent $50 a month without making me sign the lease. 

The problem is that the super chill landlord is married to a decidedly unchill woman. I will not go into detail about some of the things she’s done, but it’s very clear that her actions are malicious and deliberate. 

She took our landlord to court and had him removed from the home. She wanted both of us to sign a new lease with her, but my boyfriend refused to be her tenant. We checked the court order and confirmed with landlord and landlords lawyer that despite his absence, he is still the owner of the property, so boyfriend signed a new lease with him. After my other lease ended, I signed the lease here so I am now a legal resident here. Just to give you a sense of this woman, after she found out that he had signed a lease with landlord and not her, she turned our hot water heater down which was behind a locked door that we didn’t have the key to, and wouldn’t fix it until the landlord told her that she was interfering with our tenants rights.

We have no legal obligation to his wife. However, we share certain county amenities, such as garbage cans and a mailbox. My shipping address for deliveries has been [boyfriend FN - my initials - boyfriend LN] to ensure she wouldn’t mess with my mail before I was on the lease.

T: GOOD
B: Hello. My partner and I are looking to buy a home. We currently are in love with two houses, one is taking offers until the tonight (this is our less favorite of the two, but we still really like it) and the other (the one we’d prefer to get) is taking offers until tomorrow.

We asked our realtor what we can do here. We’d be happy with either house but obviously want the one we prefer a bit more.

She said we can offer on both of them, then have our attorney deny the offer on the less preferred home if we happen to get accepted at both. She said this is a commonly used tactic when the market is so competitive like it is today (both the houses already have 10+ offers not including our own).

This didn’t sit right with me so I looked up the laws of good faith and it sound like this is in blatant disregard to it. Could someone help me understand if this is legal? Is it unethical?  Thanks!

","IANAL. This is legal. The buy/sell contract you sign will have the ability to back out of the contract for various reasons.

Is it the most ethical, technically not because you are submitting a bid on each house and agreeing to buy it if the sellers accept.

Good faith doesn’t apply because you aren’t signing the contract with the intention of fraud. You are putting bids on multiple houses with the intention of buying one of them. 

Also it is unlikely the seller just accepts one offer. Usually they will counter the offers and continue to negotiate with the top bidders. END"

","I'm not trying to gain anything in the process. A few people had talked about a civil case, that's not something I'm trying to do. My original question was posted here to get some information on the legality of what was done. I called me bank when they opened up to try to get information on who or where the check was cashed so I could contact the business. The business when I googled it had 10-20 similar contractor names or locations and I was not willing to start calling 20 different office throughout 2 states to track down what happened. 

They could or would not give me that information but saw that it was very apparent that someone and written over the issued date. I told them the original date written which could still be seen underneath where the tried to change the date. I also told them I never authorized the change and was not the person who wrote my initials.

I at this point still don't know if it was the buyer of our home, or the business that did the work that changed the date. At this point the bank already submitted what they needed for the unauthorized forged date and I will see what comes back from there. 

Just to clarify again, i'm not trying to get out of the debt, I'm just trying to ensure some one is held accountable for changing/forging the check issued. END"

","I understand you want out of there as quick ad possible. However, if you are turning 18 very soon, within a few months, take this time to start preparing to leave. You're most likely going to need this time to prepare so your parent can't cause you a ton of problems for getting the hell out of Dodge.

Locate all your personal info like birth certificate, social security cards, banking info, etc. Get that to a safe place. Plan to get a new bank account, a new phone account and possibly phone if your parent paid for it. Look into securing your passwords and changing them. Plan how to get to and from work if the car is in his/her name. 

It's not just as easy as walking out the door. Plan ahead and be smart. Think of ways that your parent can make things hard or impossible for you. Did they pay for your computer? You might have to leave that behind,  after deleting your info, passwords and synced accounts. Its things like that that can create roadblocks to your leaving. 

Plus if you take the time to do all this and wait until you're 18, then there's fewer legal issues involved END"

B: Our lender has delayed the processing of our home mortgage. We chose this lender because they promised us early on that they will be able to meet the closing date. By the original closing date, we still hadn’t received the final underwriter approval so we moved the date by another 4 days. Now we are at the second closing date and they still haven’t got a final underwriter approval. They are very unresponsive and fail to provide any information about where our loan as it or what’s causing the delay. 
We haven’t extended the closing date yet since the listing agent hasn’t got in touch with seller yet.

Our financial contingency states that:

If the buyer is unable to obtain financing by closing after a good faith effort then, on Buyer’s notice this agreement shall terminate. The earnest money shall be refunded to the buyer after lender confirms in writing 
1. The date the loan application was made and a copy of the loan disclosure document.
2. The buyer possessed sufficient funds to close.
3. The reason buyer was unable to obtain financing by Closing.

We’ve been asking this letter on the last day of closing by the lender and they have outright refused us. We applied on time, we had sufficient funds and the reason we’re unable to close by this date is due to bank’s delay.

What’s our legal recourse here? The sellers haven’t extended the closing date yet and the bank has not provided this letter.

","So, here's the thing.  The bank is not a party to your purchase agreement and is under no obligation to provide this letter you are requesting.  In fact, this letter can only harm them as it sounds like you want them to make representations as to your financial status and their internal operations.  All this is to say, you have no legal recourse against the bank unless they have signed something and are currently in breach of an agreement or other provision of the document.

The termination of the agreement is based on you, the buyer, giving notice of the blown financing.  There are likely other provisions in the purchase agreement giving the seller the right to receive the earnest money if closing does not occur on the closing date.  

Either get a lawyer or talk to the seller about what you want to have happen here.  If you let this sit, the seller gets to keep the deposit and sell the house to someone else.  You are the party failing to abide by the terms of the agreement, not them and not the bank. END"

" Q: My son told me to post on here about my job
T: GOOD
B: I am sorry if I am doing this wrong. He set me up on this and told me to tell you what happened.

I am 53 and I live in Washington. I have Chronic Kidney Disease and received a kidney transplant.

I have been working at a tree care company for 11 years as the front desk person. I am basically a secretary, but I also help with payroll and do other things.

Around the middle of May they told me that I could not return to work at the beginning of June like the rest of the office, due to my high risk from the kidney transplant. So I have been waiting to hear when it was okay to return.

Then, yesterday, Wednesday, I received a phone call from Fernando. He started the call with ""As you know, your position has been eliminated."" Well, you may be shocked to hear this, but I didn't know. Apparently I'm the only person who didn't. They have eliminated my position, and hired someone else to take on some of the work I was doing.

Fernando told me I have two options: I have to quit, or I can accept a position as a telemarketer. He said I have 3 days to decide. He said I should take the telemarketer position because then they will keep me on my insurance. Obviously I need the insurance. Have you seen the price of anti-rejection drugs? And I have to see a lot of doctors.

My son says they are taking advantage of me. I have to miss work sometimes because of my health, and my boss is a very selfish and self-centered man. He thinks the office workers are a money drain, and he treats us like crap. Probably doesn't like that I get time off for medical reasons.

My son also thinks it's illegal for them to tell me I have to quit or take a telemarketing job. Telemarketers have a quota, and have to work 10 hour shifts. They can make really good money, but they are also treated very poorly. The Glassdoor reviews are not very kind, and the turnover is pretty high. He thinks they want me to take a telemarketing position so they can fire me for not hitting quota, and then not pay me unemployment.

He wants me to talk to a lawyer, but I don't have a lot of money. I'm not sure how to even go about that. That's why he told me to come here first. I hope you can help. Thank you!

###

","Just to verify I understand - wouldn't her position being eliminated mean she's fired, and they're offering a different job?

Mostly for the technicality of whether she quits or is fired if she does not take the telemarketer job. END"

","&gt;. all we can go off are the details given in op's post and not assume that relevant information like applying for fmla and being approved was conveniently left out.

But that's kind of my point, the missing details are very important. On this issue:

&gt;**Direct notice from the employee to the employer is not, however, always necessary.** Stevenson's case may go forward if Hyre had constructive notice of her need for FMLA leave. In *Byrne v. Avon Products,* 328 F.3d 379 (7th Cir.2003), this court held that either an employee's inability to communicate his illness to his employer or clear abnormalities in the employee's behavior may constitute constructive notice of a serious health condition. *Id.* at 381-82. **""It is enough under the FMLA if the employer knows of the employee's need for leave; the employee need not mention the statute or demand its benefits.""** ***Id.*** **at 382.**  
&gt;  
&gt;... Under the FMLA a covered employee may have up to twelve weeks of leave during any twelve month period if the employee is suffering from a **""serious health condition"" which makes him ""unable to perform the functions of \[his\] position.""** 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D); 29 C.F.R. § 825.114(a)(2)(i). A serious health condition is one which requires ""**inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility"" or continuing treatment by a health care provider**. 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). The continuing treatment test for a serious health condition is met if an employee is incapacitated by ""an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition"" for more than three consecutive days and for which he is treated by a health care provider on two or more occasions. 29 C.F.R. § 825.114(a)(2)(i).  
&gt;  
&gt;... In order to benefit from the protections of the statute, an **employee must provide his employer with enough information to show that he may need FMLA leave.** *Thorson v. Gemini, Inc.,* 205 F.3d 370, 381 (8th Cir.2000) (quoting *Browning v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,* 178 F.3d 1043, 1049 (8th Cir.1999)); 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(c), 825.303(b). Although the employee need not name the statute, *Thorson,* 205 F.3d at 381, **he must provide information to suggest that his health condition could be serious.** *Collins v. NTN-Bower Corp.,* 272 F.3d 1006, 1009 (7th Cir.2001). Employees thus have an ""affirmative duty to indicate both the need and the reason for the leave,"" **and must let employers know when they anticipate returning  to their position.** *Sanders v. May Dep't Stores Co.,* 315 F.3d 940, 944 (8th Cir.2003); 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(c).

" Q: How can my mother prove she wasnt on meth when she tested positive for it?
T: GOOD
B: Okay, so let me explain the situation its a bit of a confusing one so if i dont give enough details ask questions in the comments and ill do my best to answer as quickly as i can. Im also asking for my mother becuase shes not sure what she should do. 

 Also I'm (she) is in the state of Tennesse .

Today my mother went to a doctors office ( Issac institute of Hermitage) to get her monthly medicines that she needs for her condition.  My mother has NF1 (neurofibromatosis type one) and she was perscribed gabapentin, perks and morphine due to the lumps and pains thats cuased from her condition.  By law when she goes in to reup on her medicine she must pass a drug test inorder to receive said medications. Well today when she took it they said she failed it due to meth. My mother has not done any meth or wants to or has. She has been taking other medications which she was trying to provide and asking for annother test because she does not agree with the results of the test she took today. And the doctor said that thats what the test results said . My mother asked to take annother and have it sent to the lab sense she didnt agree with it and the doctor refused it. Sense she failed the test she is now being cut off 100% from her medicine by the doctor . My mother is so distrought right now and does not know what to do now that shes being taken off her meds that she needs. 

So, all in all is there any action she needs to take when she disagreed to the test and the doctor refused to to another and send it off to the labs, thus stripping her of the medicine she needs to take ?


Edit: I've noticed the same question being asked was about the meds. Her specialist, which is where she was getting pee tested is the doc who prescribes both the perks and the morphine for the condition . In order to get them she must pass a monthly drug test . In which she failed. She asked for annother and it was denied. It was not sent to the lab. It was done in the office. Also yall suggested that she should go to the primary care and have them list the medications shed on (the addys) and send them over . Or have them retest her . I told her what you guys suggested and shes going to go tomrrow and see if it cannot be strightened out. Sorry for any confusion.  I am posting on her behalf

","Adderall and some ADD meds are very chemically close to meth. The generic name of adderall is amphetamine salts and meth is methamphetamine. I don’t know enough about it to know if certain other meds could cause a false positive. Can she ask her pharmacist to review all her prescriptions and see if one of her current medications or a combination could have cause the positive meth result? Or seek a second opinion from another doctor, or pay for another drug test from a different lab?  I think there are private labs that do drug screens and I think you can even buy drug screening tests at places like CVS. END"

So, over the last few years of owning my property, I have wondered what a separated plot of land was on my plat. I have recently discovered that it is an old African American cemetery. Ideally, I would like to have this cemetery restored and an access road built so that family members of the deceased can visit the cemetery and pay their respects. This would require some grants or financial assistance though, as the cemetery has been left alone for so long that trees have grown in and around it, and building an access road would require a large number of trees to be removed and stormwater run-off would need to be re-assessed.  


What are my options for helping to get this cemetery restored, and how would this effect my property and the adjoining neighbor's property?

","That's good to know and certainly makes me more comfortable with the process.

I believe it was. The property has changed hands only a few times since it was split from the surrounding acres. It would take going to the courthouse to find the legacy of it's use though. END"

" Q: If I own a house that is not part of an HOA, can it at any point come to be subject to an HOA without me agreeing to it in writing?
T: GOOD
B: We are shopping for a house in San Diego, and one of our most important preferences is that it not be subject to an HOA. My question is, once I own the house (with a mortgage), can an HOA be imposed on my house without my consent, or through coercive tactics? If so, how can this happen, and what precautions, if any, can I take to reduce the risk of this happening?

###

","You can start by making sure you get an *owner's* title insurance policy in addition to the usual lender's title insurance policy that is required. Being in an HOA is something that is reflected on the title/deed. 

If someone down the line says that your property actually does belong to an HOA, you can go to your title insurance company for relief. 

Creating an HOA is a lot more involved than just having a group of homeowners come together with an agreement. They have to draw up bylaws and covenants and, most importantly, the deeds would have to be amended to reflect this. 

There have been a few posts here by folks where neighboring HOAs have tried to bully them into joining. They can request, coerce, plead, lie etc, but it's very unlikely they'd be able to successfully add your home to their organization without you first agreeing to it. END"

-the sex offender is living with my sister (which was not allowed by the previous judge, he told her that she may not have her daughter around any male she is dating) they are lying to everyone saying he doesn't live there but over the course of two months they have pictures of his vehicle parked outside at 10pm and 6am nearly every day.

I let my sister live with me for 4 years because I wanted to give her time to get on her feet and be able to take care of her daughter alone. In 4 years she never kept more than a part time job. She didn't pay bills and only contributed to the groceries with part of her food stamps. She lived like a slob and destroyed the FREE room we gave her. She didn't help with any chores. She ignored my niece and yelled at her when she was upset. Due to my own health and stress I made her move out and live with our mother ( next door to us).

","I'm a Louisiana lawyer (I can message the mods with proof if need be) but I'm not your lawyer. I have some experience with family law, but it was a few years ago. 

1) Gonna reiterate everyone else's suggestion that you call DFCS, the Department of Children and Family Services (Louisiana's version of CPS). They have a child abuse hotline. They need to know about the baths and the fact that they all sleep in the same bed. 

2) The judge is probably letting your sister continue to have overnight visits because your niece's dad hasn't yet asked to amend their custody agreement (or he has asked/filed a motion to amend it, but the judge hasn't ruled on it yet). This could be tricky depending on which part of LA you're in; not all courts are open yet. I know a few judges are still managing their dockets remotely but I have no idea how they're managing that in family courts. 

3) Just because yall have been telling everyone that the sex offender is living there doesn't mean the court actually knows that. You say your neice's father ""reports"" everything, but what exactly do you mean by that? Who does he report it to? I clerked for a judge for a few years and can tell you that we'd get calls allllll the time from pro se litigants (people representing themselves) who wanted to complain about something in their case. Even if they have the best complaint in the world, the judge can't really do anything about if you don't file a motion to ask the court to do something and include some supporting evidence. I'd be happy to explain this in more detail if you'd like. 

4) Again, it's very important to have physical proof that he's living there (multiple time-stamped pictures of his car in the driveway would be a good start) and your niece's father needs to show that to the court (or have his attorney do it). Even better if you can get pictures of his car there when she has visitation. Witness testimony is OK, but physical proof is better. It can also make cases get heard more quickly- sometimes a hearing will have to be pushed back to another date if you need witness testimony, because they have to make sure they set the hearing on a date when everyone can attend. 

5) The fact that your sister is planning on moving to Texas and not returning is really important. You need to make sure that your niece's father knows that and that he tells the court (or that his attorney tells the court). From what I remember, a parent planning to leave the state without informing the court/the other parent was treated as a big deal by family court judges. 

6) I think it's against this sub's rules to recommend any legal services, but I'm not sure if that applies to legal aid services since some of them are quasi-governmental (mods: please let me know if you consider this to be against the rules and I'll edit this part out). At any rate, I can tell you with certainty that there are legal aid clinics in Louisiana that will take custody cases for low-income people if your niece's father meets the income requirements. He'll have to apply; you can't do it for him since you're not the parent. And he'll probably have to pay for the filing costs since they usually can't cover that, but it'll hopefully only be a few hundred dollars max vs. thousands if you hired a private attorney. END"

","I am a lawyer but not your lawyer and not in your state. This is based on California. 

Echoing other comments here about calling CPS. The former friend can call, the dad can call, you can call and give the information.  

CPS will go to the home, initially unannounced, and interview everyine including the child  as well as neighbors about the comings and goings at the home. 

In CA if a cps case is filed with the court, parents are appointed counsel and fees are based on income. Many pay little to  nothing. 

Give as much  specific information about the BF so they can look him up. Give specific information about the baths,  sleeping arrangements etc. Detail the risk of mom fleeing with the child.

So long as the dad does not have his own child safety issues,  CPS would likely place the child with him and give the mom monitored visits while the case progresses. The mom can be given referrals for sexual abuse awareness and parenting classes. In the end, the court can issue a revised custody order. END"

They are telling me that they want to use this money to pay off their own rent instead of me using it for my own education. Isn't this illegal? The loan is meant to be for school. I don't have a bank account because they are withholding my birth certificate and social security card so the loan can't be in my name, and only theirs. Would it be fraud if they got a loan intended to pay for their children's education and just used it on themself?

Edit: I am currently in New Jersey and I will be attending college in New York for my first year.

My office’s sewer pipe burst around March so my office got flooded with shit water and because of that, I had to start working from home. Then, obviously Covid happened so they moved all of us remote. We had a big conference call yesterday and on the call we were told that we would be going back to the offices next week. My manager told me over the phone that I would have to take out the carpet tiles by myself and replace them. She said that it “wouldn’t be hard to do” and that there was extra tiles left in the office. 
My concern is that the office has been shut since March and not cleaned up or aired out the whole time. The sewer pipe isn’t even fixed yet. Isn’t this some type of health hazard? I’m located in Philadelphia if that helps!

","It sounds like your superiors are presuming that you are your office's facility / property manager.

First, don't work from that office until you know it's fixed properly.  You are looking out for your employer's interest along with your own.

Do your best to safely do your own inspection (video / pictures / detailed notes) of the property.  Then obtain estimates from appropriate contractors to fix everything properly.  

Ideally, you'd submit your choice for approval, would get approval, and would get a company check to pay for everything.  If you have a company credit card, and the estimates fall within the rules of your usage of that company credit card, pick the contractor yourself, and fix that place ASAP.

Do not do any type of work yourself, UNLESS you are a trained professional in the type of repair, AND you get an approved purchase order (at your desired rates) for work done as PaddyStars the Plumber / Tiler / Hazardous Materials specialist, as opposed to being paid as PaddyStars the recruiter.

Good Luck. END"

" Q: SC - Mom fired over text 'for cause' due to 'lack of communication' while she was in the Hospital with Pnemonia + orgain failure.
T: GOOD
B: \*organ failure, don't type while crying.

Hello all - writing from the state of South Carolina.

A few weeks ago my mom came down with a bad flu, she tested negative for COVID but things progressed to the point where she was hospitalized and had a severe case of bacterial Pneumonia, sodium dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

The whole time, my mom was communicative to her employer, a self-owned eye ware business.

She was written a text from her employer yesterday stating she was being terminated for cause due to lack of communication and that her belongings would be mailed to her and she would be paid through yesterday + her 4 remaining days of vacation.

I googled firing 'for cause' and it says that it has to be a very serious misconduct - that doesn't seem to apply here.

I also don't know how she could actually fire her over her being hospitalized! and she WAS in communication!

~~I know SC is a right to work state~~,I was wrong on this, South Carolina is an 'at will' state so I think they can fire/hire at their discretion ---&gt;  so we may be out of luck. But my mom has a lot of follow up appointments and now has no medical insurance or income. I would think at the very least, a severance package would be fair.

Input, advice? thanks so much. will check back in as i can.

" Q: Downstairs Neighbor has had bedbugs and never told the landlord, now we have bed bugs.
T: GOOD
B: Me and my girlfriend recently moved into a duplex in Northeast Ohio in March, the downstairs neighbors were quarantined so we didn't meet them right away but seemed like nice people. Boy was I wrong. To make a long story short, shes a antivaxx mom with a piece of her brain removed and refuses to use chemical cleaners around her 5 kids she screams at all day. She has even gone to the lengths of asking us to change our cleaning routines because she doesn't like the smell of our products.

So a few weeks go by and we find a bedbug in our room, initially we just ask the neighbors if she has had any problems with them before but she claimed they were from the previous tenants. So we take pictures of the bug and send it to the landlord as proof. We end up talking to the neighbor some more and we come to find out that she has been dealing with bedbugs for quite some time. After some back and forth with the landlord and many bug bites later, he hires and exterminator to come. During the period up to the exterminators we took all of our bedding and laundry to the laundromat to clean and prevent any further contamination, which was very expensive.

The exterminators come and inspect our apartment, they don't see any signs of infestation or nests so they just spray our rooms and mattresses. They go downstairs and do the same but I notice it takes a bit longer.

A week or so goes by and once again my girlfriend and her kids have bites again. We do the same thing as before; Document and send to he landlord. Once again he has the exterminators come, same guys as before. So I ask them if the downstairs was bad and he confirmed that they were the reason for the infestation. They have not taken any measures to get rid of the infestation downstairs. So we informed the landlord and he basically gives us the ""My hands are tied right now"" deal because of the eviction orders because of COVID.

Last night I found another bedbug and I am at my wits end with this whole situation. Our landlord has been fairly decent about the whole thing, but I'm to the point where I feel I can't live here comfortably.

So my question is do I have any legal grounds? Can I sue for my deposit or rent money back because of this?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Downstairs neighbors are gross and have bedbugs that keep coming up to our apartment, they refuse to do anything about it. What legal grounds do I have?

","I would probably start with that quite honestly. Reoccurring bedbugs with no attempts to remedy the situation imo is an indication of neglect. I suspect at the very minimum it would get that issue resolved fairlu quickly, especially if the kids have visible bites. END"

","Spraying is not an effective treatment for bedbugs, as they can retreat into the walls and avoid the spray. If you only treat one unit, they will escape into the other one. They breed incredibly fast and once they have had a blood meal, they can survive for months without another one. The only way to ensure that you don't just keep passing them back and forth is to heat treat the entire unit. You need to convince your landlord to do this. Downstairs neighbor should have no objections because it doesn't involve chemicals, but it is a pain in the butt (you will need to remove anything that can melt or that would be damaged by heat from the house and the process takes several hours). Your landlord can either keep paying to have an ineffective treatment again and again, or they can spring for the effective treatment, which hopefully you should only have to do once (although sometimes they have to come back more than once). 

However, since your landlord is technically paying to have the situation resolved, as long as they keep paying every time you find the bugs, there isn't much you can sue them for. They are taking steps to resolve the situation, even if they aren't 100% effective steps. Your best course of action is to reason with them. If you send them evidence that the infestation persists and they refuse to pay for another treatment, then you may have a case, so keep documenting and sending them notice in writing every time you find a bedbug.  You can contact the health department to put pressure on your landlord to remedy the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Insect infestations are a public nuisance in Cleveland health and safety codes. The health department considers bed bugs to be an insect infestation. They will inspect and issue orders to landlords to treat infestations.**

","What state are you in? Eviction orders vary. I know, in WA for example, evictions can and will still be processed for lease violations impacting the health and safety of other residents/neighbors. I’m pretty sure bed bugs would qualify!  
  
This said, it would be on your landlord to enforce. You can’t compel him to unless there’s language in your lease (there’s usually not).  
  
Your recourse, as shitty as it is, is to move. You could probably get out of your lease. You may be able to go after LL for losses.  
  
Maybe there’s some regulatory body you could complain to directly so that they could pursue both the LL and neighbor? Depends on where you are.
  
You may also have some relevant coverage if you have a good renter’s policy. For example, it may pay for a few days in a hotel if you’ve been displaced. END"

The server follows the EULA for minecraft and the Discord ToS, he has done a bit of website work in the past which he has deleted, though he sent an email (which was just [https://www.upcounsel.com/demand-letter](https://www.upcounsel.com/demand-letter) as a template) saying he will presue legal actions.

The server is just a hobby between a few people, I'm curious if he has any grounds for anything or would this case just be laughed at?

Edit:There was also no transferrance of money, no contracts involved or him asking me to pay

Edit2: (Also posted as a comment)  
Bit of an update, thanks a heap for all your replies they have been awesome to read.

I can confirm he is about 20 years old

I'm not sure any reason he would be sueing me, there was no agreement or contract involving money, or anything really. I think the grounds he would be trying to sue me for is defermation of charactor as I said he was incompetent at the job I got him to do, and because I said that to other people.

He is also attempting to trademark the servers name in the united states and europe, he then said that he will go to all the companies that the server is hosted on and send them a cease and desist getting them to remove my files and postings etc.

This was starting to worry me as I have anxiety and I was getting really upset thinking that I'm going to have to change the name of the server, and take all these precautions to stop this sort of thing from happening. My mate said even if he does sue me I can counter sue him for harassment and/or emotional damagers as well. As he is trying to go to other people on the server and contact me through them as I have blocked him on all platforms and have asked him not to try and contact me.

He is causing the rest of the server to worry about things.

Is this something I should be worried about at all? I have already backed up all files.

He is causing the rest of the server to worry about things.

Is this something I should be worried about at all? I have already backed up all files.

###

","&gt;He just uploaded a website he had a license for, then edited some css or something.

Sounds like he took a free template, changed the default colours and maybe tweaked the layout a bit. As a software developer I can tell you the going rate for that type of work is $hahaha-you-want-me-to-PAY-for-this?.

If you can find someone you trust who has some HTML/web experience, they can probably tell by looking at the site if he just used a default install of Joomla, WordPress or some other freely available Content Management System. If he has, you can compare the default files with your current website and figure out just how much/little he did. END"
" Q: [Texas] HOA misusing rule?
T: GOOD
B: Our HOA is sending me a fine over bare patches in my lawn where the shade is keeping the grass from growing. The rule they cite in the violation notices reads as follows:

&gt; Drying of clothes in public view is prohibited and owners of any lots shall screen from public view yard equipment, wood piles, or storage piles which are incidental to the normal residential requirements of a typical family.

That's the entire rule. Nothing in there about bare patches. I asked them which drying clothes, yard equipment, wood piles, or storage piles they're referring to, and they stated quite clearly that it's about the bare spots.

I also asked them if perhaps the version of the rules on the website were out of date, thinking maybe there was a vote and the new version mentions generic unsightliness. Their reply was several paragraphs, but I think the must relevant part is this bit:

&gt; The Covenants and Restrictions on the website are what we have, though we are trying to get them updated, but it is a lengthy process, involving voting by the HOA and special HOA lawyers. We are trying to update, but it is quite involved and not an easy process, so we must use what we have, thus the unsightly description is outdated, but is helpful in addressing unsightliness.

Am I wrong in thinking that they can't actually expand the scope of that rule without holding a vote first? Do I have any legal recourse here? I _have_ been working on getting grass in there, but apparently not fast enough for them.

Thank you all!

","not legal advice but grass advice. if you have a st augustine variety (most common in texas) look into getting some of the palmetto type (shade tolerant) of st augustine in plugs or sod to patch the area, it cant be seeded as its a gmo grass. if you want to seed consider centipede seed for a very similar look

I have a mix of palmetto and centipede growing up to within 3 feet of multiple century + old live oaks. bare spots in these grasses are generally caused by fungal issues, insect damage or lack of water. in shady areas like you mention the most common cause is a combination of fungal (grey leaf spot) and insect (sod web worm). cutting back the water slightly and applying a systemic fungicide(pick one: propiconazole, azoxystrobin, or myclobutanil) and a systemic pesticide (cheap: imidacloprid expensive: clothianidin safest: chlorantraniliprole) would allow the lawn to recover, but only do so after you verify its necessary.

When i was 9 -10 yrs old, my moms boyfriend sexually assaulted me , I didn’t realize it at the time . A year later he tried again and also attempted to seduce me and i knew something was wrong . I told my mom and she said it was my decision if i wanted him in the house or not but she also said that he’s the only man in the house and that we need a man to protect us . I knew he made her happy so i said he can stay . After that I never talked to him and i always make sure to keep my distance . I am now 15. Yesterday I was at a friends house (who lives one house away from me) when my younger brother texted me that my mom and her bf had an argument , my mom told my brother to stay away from the boyfriend bc he was crazy . I started asking him questions asking if the boyfriend was drunk ( he drinks ) and if my mom was crying or anything , he didn’t have the answers to my questions and he said my mom was in her room . He also said that my moms boyfriend was outside in the dark . Then he texted me saying that the power shut off .

","Okay so it looks like it's going to be very dependent on what exactly happened. I don't want to make you relive or recount that so i'm going to provide you a link to RAINN, the rape, abuse, and incest national network. 

[THis link ](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=California&amp;group=7&amp;_ga=2.138272560.1494258512.1591904138-1200586637.1591904138) Provides a breakdown of the various offenses and the statute of limitations for each offense. At a cursory glace it looks like the statute of limitations is pretty lenient towards victims so take your time. 

IANAL yet technically, i just graduated. But  i'm working in the field of criminal law under another attorney's bar card, i can't tell you what to do but if there's any language you want explained i'm happy to help.

Edit: I'm sorry i realized i didn't exactly answer your question. Frankly IDK if you have enough to keep him away from a family law standpoint, but it's pretty standard that if he's convicted of an offense he cannot legally have contact with his victim (you). Also, you know, jail. END"

" Q: (NY) my boyfriend made a will before he died and said he wanted me to keep his remains. do I have to give them to his parents because we weren't married?
T: GOOD
B: throwaway acct.

my boyfriend and I were together for 3 years, lived together for two, but were not married. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness a few months ago and died in early May, and was cremated. he also named me the executor of his will. 

he was estranged from his family and didn't want them to have access to his remains. he wanted everything left to me (save a few things for friends) and wanted me to keep his remains with instructions for disposal of some at certain intervals. 

the will hasn't completed probate yet, but I do have his remains. I haven't ""done"" anything with them yet and they're still in the box they came to me in. 

 his family demanded the ashes from me, he hadn't seen them in five years at this point, even when he was sick and dying. I said that the will said he wanted me to keep them and that the lawyer said that was ok. 

several people, not just his family but otherwise, have said that it doesn't matter what his will said, if they want the remains I have to give them to them because we weren't married. 

the lawyer basically said that they could fight it out in probate if it was that important, but many people are trying to tell me I need to give them to them because they asked for them, and honestly it's all just confusing and overwhelming. I'm pregnant with our child and not really equipped to deal with this rn
 
1) do I have to give the ashes to them right now? 
2) what's the genuine likelihood of them making me give them the ashes in court even though his will says otherwise? 

it's sickening to me to be talking about what is literally him like a possession but I really need some clear answers. if I had known that this would end up being like this I would have pushed to get married quickly before he died 😭

right now, you're in possession of the remains, and if they want to take control of them, they will need to prove to a court that they can take them from you.

your channel probably wouldn't have been this popular if it wasn't for him, but then again it probably wouldn't have gotten this far if it wasn't for at least 70% of your videos.

T: GOOD
B: I’m located in Seattle, WA, USA. When my ex and I broke up, he blocked me from phone and social media, refused to let me retrieve my stuff. I found him on WhatsApp and told him to mail my belongings to me, gave him my address. It was DJ equipment, clothing, etc. totaling upwards of $1,000. I gave him my address and blocked him.

Today, after a month, I break No Contact to check up on my personal items. He said he had delivered my items a week ago.

Instead of using a secure courier like UPS or USPS, he called an Uber, gave the Uber driver my box of belongings. The Uber driver tried calling the callbox but there was no answer, so he gave up and left my belongings in an unsecured area outside my apartment complex. The Uber driver sent my ex snapshots of the box by the door. My ex could have given the Uber driver my phone number to ensure receipt but instead just instructed him to leave my stuff outside the building (I assume for vindictive purposes).

" Q: My ex hired an Uber driver to drop off my belongings outside my apartment complex, not at my doorstep in a secured building, without notifying me. My belongings got stolen. Can I make a small claims filing?
T: BAD
B: I’m located in Seattle, WA, USA. When my ex and I broke up, he blocked me from phone and social media, refused to let me retrieve my stuff. I found him on WhatsApp and told him to mail my belongings to me, gave him my address. It was DJ equipment, clothing, etc. totaling upwards of $1,000. I gave him my address and blocked him.

Today, after a month, I break No Contact to check up on my personal items. He said he had delivered my items a week ago.

Instead of using a secure courier like UPS or USPS, he called an Uber, gave the Uber driver my box of belongings. The Uber driver tried calling the callbox but there was no answer, so he gave up and left my belongings in an unsecured area outside my apartment complex. The Uber driver sent my ex snapshots of the box by the door. My ex could have given the Uber driver my phone number to ensure receipt but instead just instructed him to leave my stuff outside the building (I assume for vindictive purposes).

T: GOOD
B: A very bad storm just rolled through and one of my family's biggest fears came to fruition, there was a large rotting dead tree near the edge of the property that we expressed concern for him to remove since around 2 years ago and it fell on our car completely crushing it. it also badly damaged the windshield of our second car.

We consulted two tree removal companies for quotes OVER A YEAR AGO who both said the tree was dangerous and needed to be removed, we have the quotes saved. He still refused to do anything about it, and we have an email from the previous property manager acknowledging he knew about the tree from over a year ago. 

We called him as soon as it happened and he was hysterical on the phone, saying it was our fault for not having comprehensive insurance on the car (only had liability), that he told us ""not to fucking park near that tree"" (we didn't, we parked right beside our house and it fell in a way we hadn't anticipated it would fall, the wind pushed it away from where it looked like it would fall, it was the top of the tree that hit the car), and that hes ""fucking fed up"" and is going to sell all his properties, implying he plans on evicting us.

Im posting this on behalf of my parents so I dont have all the details yet, they are very distraught and this car was very special to my mom even though it was just an 02 lexus, its irreplaceable for her. 

are we in the wrong for not having comprehensive insurance on the car? is there anything we can do? 

we have always been a poor family, we didnt have money for comprehensive on that car, my parents run a business which is why we have 2 cars, the car we have left barely runs as it is 

I took pictures of the damage from all angles, is there anything else I or my parents should be doing, and where can we go from here?

we have renters insurance but I dont think it covers this. my mom has been a broker for 10 years so I figure she knows what she's talking about 

thanks so much in advance, its a really hard time right now

EDI we live in Ontario Canada, forgot to add that

EDIT 2: he also said things on the phone like ""you pay low rent i can't afford to be doing all this"" (trust me we dont) which I find funny because we don't even have proper plumbing or electrical in this house either, cant even turn the sink on when someone's in the shower, you get electric shocks from anything plugged in the garage, hes fixed none of this either

edit 3: I guess i should make the intent more clear, we want him to compensate us for the damage and also not fucking evict us but I think the former is more pressing since I dont see how the latter would be legally possible. if he's genuinely planning on selling all his properties should we be organizing with the other tenants?

","Well, there are a few things going on here:

(1) If your parents executed a gift letter and intended it to be a loan they committed fraud;

(2) Your father is *currently* an equal co-owner of your home. If he's sued for any reason, his undivided 1/3 interest in your home could be seized by a judgment creditor. If he files bankruptcy his interest can be subject to seizure by a trustee.

The optimal way for this to have been handled would have been for a promissory note or a second mortgage (which would have alerted your lender to the loan, which is why you didn't do this) to have secured his interest *and only his interest*. That ship is sailed. Can you just save up cash as quickly as possible (or do a cash-out refinance), buy him out, and have a new deed executed that takes him off the deed? That would probably be the cleanest way forward. 

If that isn't an option, you should speak to an attorney have have a real contract drafted up that specific establishes the rights and responsibilities of all parties. Failure to do this means that upon sale, he's getting a check at closing. END"

The fact that you presented them with a special accommodation letter and they still refuse works in your favor, since I highly doubt any agency would consider getting you a different kind of mask as difficult to accommodate; if they don't accommodate or attempt to punish you, file a claim with the Department of Labor or whatever agency covers protected status issues in your area.

","This is where they would have to do their research and show studies proving this. You can also do your research as well and find studies disproving this. The only mask that is proven to be the most effective is N95 masks, which the CDC does not recommend because they’re needed by health professionals. 

Both the CDC and the World Health Organization recommend a cloth mask. The AIM found that a cloth mask actually offers better protection than a surgical mask. As long as you don’t touch your mask, then you’d be fine.

","Look up New Jersey's Worker Freedom From Employer Intimidation Act, which went into effect in 2006. It protects employees against certain forms of religious and political intimidation at work. Specifically, it prohibits companies from requiring employees to attend meetings or to participate in communications regarding the employer’s opinion about religious or political issues. The law defines “political matters” to include affiliation with a political party, as well as decisions to join, not join, or participate in “any lawful political, social, or community organization or activity.”

Despite that prohibition, the act allows employers to invite employees to voluntarily attend employer-sponsored meetings and to provide other religious and political communications to their employees as long as make it clear the employees will not be penalized if they refuse to attend the meetings or accept the communications.

","Honestly his best bet would probably be to look in the employee handbook.  Most large organizations such as hospitals have restrictions on political speech/demonstrations that represent the organization itself.  As this situation is political it would fall under that policy guideline and disparate treatment for following the guideline could give him some legal protection.  

Beyond that I'm honestly not sure as the first amendment applies to the government restricting speech. END"

She’s been very clear and unwavering on the fact that she does not want to date him or have anything to do with him. He was controlling and possessive when they were dating, hence the breakup, and is now behaving like she owes him a relationship.

When she blocks him on social media, it goes quiet for a bit, then he creates a new account and messages her. If she doesn’t immediately respond he blows up  her phone with “why aren’t you answering me, I know you read this” messages. He has shown up at her work several times just to stand around and watch her. (The company has stated they will call the police if it happens again and trespass him) He’s left expensive gifts, notes professing his love and now he sends messages not explicitly threatening but meant to unnerve her. The latest was a middle of the night message that said “maybe this will get your attention” then a couple hours later he sent a pic of a daemon looking creature...it just will not stop.

We’ve gone to the police and filed a report. They were sympathetic but said none of this is illegal so there’s nothing they can do. We’ve been told to not ever respond in any way. Not to even say stop. The officer said if her or I respond even to tell him to stop, it would be hard to ever make a harassment case if there’s 2 way communication.

T: GOOD
B: I live in Georgia, USA. I signed up for accommodations last semester, and recently they have been sending out a ""Special Populations Newsletter"" each month with resources for us- for which I am grateful. But I noticed there were more than 60 people CC'd, and I thought that that couldn't possibly be other students. We were told getting accommodations was confidential and no one would have to know besides our teachers, unless we disclosed the information to our peers if we wanted to. I decided to open the CC'd emails and.... they all had student in the email address. I recognized two names on the list before I closed it back out, one of which I had already known about her accommodations because she told me. The other I didn't know about, and I shouldn't know about. I decided to reach out to the SP coordinator to ask why it was sent like that. In order to shorten the rather long string of emails, I'll list the info I gathered in bullet points.

* Not everyone in SPops is disabled! Here is our list of services \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. No one will know you're here because you are disabled!
* We did say it was confidential, but only your specific disability is confidential, not the fact that you utilize special populations.
* My boss has mentioned that maybe we should BCC instead, but we aren't very strict about it as no one is complained and we don't see it as an issue.
* Don't worry, its only a list of other people in special populations, it doesn't tell them your specific accommodations information!

She ended up calling personally to apologize, but it felt more like ""we're sorry your feelings got hurt"" than a genuine apology. I was just going to let it slide but I felt like she was more worried about deescalating than the fact that our names are visible to everyone in the email. I get that only other people in special populations can see it, but that's not the point. I was led to believe no one would be made aware, and that did not end up being the case. I feel betrayed.

I don't even know where to begin on trying to find out if there were any legal issues here. I just want to do something so this doesn't keep happening, because they didn't take me seriously. They spoke to me as if I was a child and said that they would do better in the future, as if 60+ of my peers don't already have my name and potentially know I'm in SPops when they shouldn't. Any pointers would be appreciated, even if it's letting me know I'm overreacting and there's no legal issue at hand. I just want to know where to go from here.

These records include but are not limited to grades, transcripts, class lists, student course schedules, health records (at the K-12 level), student financial information (at the postsecondary level), and student discipline files. The information may be recorded in any way, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer media, videotape, audiotape, film, microfilm, microfiche, and e-mail.

And sharing that information (that you have accommodations) with other students would definitely not fall under FERPA's list of allowable times to share educational records without permission.  A summary of FERPA, including the exceptions, can be found here: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html

Your University likely has a mechanism for reporting inappropriate behaviors, including FERPA violations, through an Ombudsman office or a complaint hotline. Additionally, you can file a FERPA violation complaint here: https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-complaint END"

","Sounds like you don't have a guest anymore, you have a subtenant. Going off this website, it looks like they will both need to give the friend a 3 day quit notice:

" Q: My insurance company denied my medicine and it put me in the hospital. Should my family sue the insurance company?
T: GOOD
B: TLDR: My insurance company denied my medication due to an error in their system and it put me in the hospital in a lot of pain. Do I have grounds to sue them?

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 16 and have had many hospital visits since. In August of 2019 my intestines had a scar tissue build up requiring me to get emergency surgery to remove part of my small intestine and part of my colon.

I had been receiving Remicade infusions for my condition before this event but after a while my insurance company deemed it medically unnecessary.
After the surgery they approved me again for an infusion while in the hospital. At this point I was in remission and the doctor said that with continued infusions I would be able to stay in remission. Then when it came time for my next infusion the insurance company denied it once again. (Also this medication cost around $43000 without insurance).

My doctor's office and my parents both tried many times over a 6 month span to get me my medicine. Everytime though the insurance company denied their requests.

Then in March of 2020 I came out of remission and had a flare up due to the lack of medicine. (Each of these flare ups is extremely putting me into screaming pain for hours on end). My parents now furious at this point with the fact that I'm back in the hospital once again are contacting the insurance company and finally get someone at the company to look into the my file. (Only because I was in the hospital once again). Come to find out the insurance company had made a mistake when denying the medication when I was supposed to be  approved.

This mistake left me without medication for that 6 month period and landed me in the hospital in a tremendous amount of pain.

Does my family have grounds to sue the insurance company?

Edit: I'm in Houston, TX

Edit: Thanks for all the great info about Jansen carepath luckily I recently got into their program and I am getting my medicine soon!

Edit: The insurance company said they had coded something wrong in their system and that caused me to be denied.

","Lawyer but not your lawyer here.  First off, I'm sorry about your situation.  It sounds very difficult and frustrating.  Theoretically there could be a negligence claim here.  One issue though is that you are not providing very much information about the mistake.  How do you know it was a mistake? Did they tell you? Did they say, ""Sorry we entered in the information wrong,""  ""We made a bad managerial decision, "" or was it more along the lines that they claimed the insurance agreement meant they did not have to insure you until your condition became severe enough.  There are also complicated issues related to causation.  There is plenty to pursue here but you need a lawyer and not just some random personal injury lawyer.  You should find a lawyer that specializes in healthcare personal injury.  Although you aren't suing the doctor, a medical malpractice lawyer might be of some help since they have to deal with very similar issues. END"

B: I work in sales at a large beverage company and my company just announced that they will be eliminating my current role and turning it into a new position that’s more work with less benefits. They are giving us 2 days to sign a contract agreeing and say if we don’t, it will count as is voluntarily quitting and there not offering a severance. Is there any options or are they just in doing that? 

The new role is our same hourly wage but they are taking away a monthly car allowance and lowering our gas mileage reimbursement rate etc.

" Q: Skip the dishes delivery drivers.
T: GOOD
B: Hey everyone.

I am located in Canada. Recently I've installed a smart doorbell so I can keep an eye on the kid across my street who's got the cops called on him daily and swears at me when i see him. Completely unrelated to that however is the fact skip the dishes continually uses my driveway to get to my neighbors door as it's easier then walking around her grass and saves potentially 7-10 seconds of walking.

I have emailed skip the dishes 6 times with pictures of their drivers hitting my cars and walking between them after complaining. They tell me I need to have the customers order number to do anything but my neighbors will not help me out. I've sent them all the pictures and asked repeatedly to help but the simply will not.

What are my options as they are littering in my yard, parking extremely close to my vehicles and hit my vehicles with their red skip bags... Its driving me bonkers and I would appreciate any help or advice.

Even without damage I'd still consider a letter from an attorney about why you don't trespass on people's land. END"

" Q: Bank made a mistake and cashed a check twice which seriously overdrew my account
T: GOOD
B: TL;DR: About $10,000 is still missing and the bank is yet to return my money. 12 days later...

I live in Ohio and got my driveway re-paved two weeks ago and paid the company with a check. When the company submitted the check for deposit the mobile system processed the check twice. So what should have been ~$10,000 withdraw from turned out to be ~$20,000. This severely overdrew my account because we only keep enough in that account to cover bills. I was charged $36 overdraft fee as well which I had to fight to get back. 

I got an alert on my phone that the account was overdrawn and got the mistaken withdrawal returned to bring my account back to positive which took three business days. Fun fact: if an account is overdrawn you can’t use it. 

I got a call from the driveway company stating that the check bounced and they did not get paid which is puzzling because the original amount (~$10,000) is still missing.  I called the bank again and they said “no the money did not go to the company and it will be returned to your account following an investigation as to what happened. This should take two business days” 

My wife and I discussed it and we wanted to pay our debt so we transferred from our savings account the money to cover the cost of the driveway and told the company we would deal with the bank. 

It has been 6 business days and still I do not have my money from the bank back in my account. Every time I call the bank I have to explain all of this to someone new and then they “contact a manager” and I get the run-around about the process and it should be resolved soon.

I am by no means rich. We get by and this new driveway payment took quite some time to save. Is there anything that I should be doing other than calling the bank every single day until I get my money?

Quick update: I finally spoke with someone that has decided to bird-dog this thing for me and try and get some answers about everything. She has called me almost too often to ask questions and give updates. She said she would call first thing in the morning if she has more to update.

","Just out of curiosity is either of the withdrawal showing as pending? I’ve seen that happen before.

I would not bother going to the bank with kids in tow. I’ve worked in banking for 15 + years. The bank would be calling the same number you call. I would call customer service ask for a supervisor. Be nice but firm. If they are not giving you an acceptable resolution, you you threaten to sue or go to the media, that will likely get a resolution faster. END"

" Q: 2 years of harrassment from tenants next door.
T: GOOD
B: INDIANA- Hi all. I am turning to reddit to see if anyone can offer insight.  my husband and I are home owners who live next to renters who have continually harassed us for 2+ years and are out of control. they refuse to stay off our property, call the police if a ball goes in our yard we don't IMMEDIATELY return it (within 3 min), spray painted our fence, yell insults at me when I am outside, etc. we have built a  privacy fence, continually make it clear all we want is for them to stay away from our family (she came pounding on door yesterday) and we have continuously contacted their landlord about numerous harrassment issues  (too many to list). I have also sought out police advice and really they seem to always treat it as a neighbor squabble though it is much more and genuinely a threat to my family  (our safety bc they are very clearly emotionally unstable and a threat to out peace of mind). The landlords run a property group and are often regarded as slumlords, they never return my calls and refuse to get their tenants in check. the police recommended possibly filing a protective order but said it would likely get denied bc those tend to be given in domestic abuse cases. I have photos and dates of the harrassment and phone records to police/landlord from past 2 years (Its gone on longer but that's when we began documenting). I truly just want something that ensures they stay away from me so I can feel comfortable and come home from work without fearing a confrontation/being ambushed.  I feel as if my hands are tied and not sure how to get their unresponsive landlords to act. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

So what? Let them call the police. This isn't a crime.

&gt; spray painted our fence

Have you reported this vandalism to the police? You may also have a potential suit against the neighbor and/or landlord for the vandalism.

&gt; yell insults at me when I am outside

Have you reported this harassment to the police?

Have you reported this harassment to the police?

&gt; the police recommended possibly filing a protective order

Have you sought a protective order? Indiana allows these orders, but will not grant them *ex parte* - meaning you have to go to court and the other side gets a chance to contest your allegations.

I'm not sure why you keep bringing their landlord into this. It's not his problem. END"

",As you have stated that there is reasonable documentation of contacting the landlord about this issue I would file a nuisance lawsuit in small claims court for damages against the landlord.  I would also contact other neighbors to see if they are also being affected by the tenants behavior as this would add validity to the lawsuit.  You can file yourself or get an attorney.  As this has been going on for so long I would stronly consider an attorney to make sure this suit is successful. END

" Q: Unbearable smell coming from apartment below us
T: GOOD
B: There is a horrible burning plastic smell that has filled our apartment once a week for the past 5 weeks; this week has now been twice.  We have been in contact with the leasing office for the apartment complex several times.  We confronted different neighbors last week and no one could smell it.  When we confronted our downstairs neighbor, as soon as the door opened we could smell it.  She claimed it was bad firewood from Seven Eleven.  It is June and around 60°F at night; we do not believe this is firewood.  The smell always starts between 9 P.M. and 2 A.M. and takes hours to air out of our apartment.  It also causes us to wake us up in the middle of the night.

We have suspicions that it might be the smell of smoking crack, but so far the apartment people haven't done anything besides call our neighbors to ask them if they smelled anything.  Is there anything else that we can do because we can't take it anymore.

Location: Oregon

Update:  Just received a call from leasing office stating that they would launch an investigation to find out where the smell is coming from.  They mentioned that they called the apartment below us and that they had smelled the same thing.  I have a 5-6 week old email chain stating the different times that we smelled the burning plastic smell, so hopefully they will be able to figure out what it is.  I read most of the comments and it seems best route is to wait for it to happen again then call the fire department while the smell is still around.  Thank you everyone for your input!

","It is a court order. If you don’t show, they could realistically send a sheriff to go and pick you up or charge you for violating an order of the court. 

I work as a prosecutor, and I can confidentially say that I would never send a sheriff to go and pick up a victim and would never press that a victim be charged for not appearing at trial. 

HOWEVER, it is so vital that you go. He won’t ever have to serve his punishment for what he did to you if you don’t. The prosecutor likely can’t prove it without you. If you don’t show up, the man who battered you walks away completely free and doesn’t ever have to pay for what he did. He will be free to walk out into the world without a single repercussion. 

I know it is extremely difficult. I’ve walked many terrified and traumatized victims through trial, and it isn’t easy... but talk to the prosecutor and your victim advocate. The victim advocate’s job is to make sure you are heard. I am always heartbroken when I have to dismiss a case because the victim is too traumatized... that means that the victimizer wins in so many ways. 
Talk it over with the people you love and see if, with their support, you can find strength to face your accuser and work to make sure he is punished for what he did to you. Because it matters and the court needs to hear who he is. END"

" Q: Was fired from my company less than 24 hours after disclosing my pregnancy to HR.
T: GOOD
B: Sorry if this is kind of long! I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.

I've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our ""HR"" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.

December came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.

The company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss/ceo/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.

Unrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.

I have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.

My review was with our CEO/owner and our ""HR"" yesterday. He essentially leads the entire meeting, telling me that I was a great find for the company, came at just the right time when I did (called me a ""miracle""), and then proceeds to say that my role is has not become what he wanted it to be and rather than letting me go back to my old position, they are going to ""phase me out"". This was a confusing way of putting it because they told me that was my last day, not to come in next week, but they would pay me for two more weeks of work in addition to what I'm owed for hours worked in January. He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else. Our HR person chimes in to say that if i want to come in for a lunch to ""honor me"" they can arrange for that. The ceo/owner tells me that I probably have a lot of questions, but he says he doesn't want me to ask any of them now and that I can call/email him later with any questions or concerns that I may have. The whole thing felt very weird to me, but I was also very emotional and visibly upset.

This whole thing has me shocked and extremely scared. Even if I find another job right away, I will not qualify for FMLA once our baby arrives and it seems most places have a 1 year policy before maternity leave kicks in anyways. At this point I'm trying to figure out what my legal rights are. I'm in Oregon, so I know I'm in an ""at will"" state or whatever it's called. Does anyone have any advice on whether or not there's enough info here to pursue anything against my previous employer? I've filed for unemployment, and I'm actively searching for jobs but there's not much available in my field in my city at the moment.

","The [Pregnancy Discrimination Act](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm) makes it illegal for any employer in the U.S. with 15 or more workers to treat employees unfairly because they are pregnant. That means:

Your boss can’t fire you or cut your hours when she finds out that you’re pregnant—you have the right to keep working as long as you can still do your job. You also have the right to be free from harassment at work because you are pregnant.

You cannot be asked about your pregnancy or plans to have children in a job interview.

Your employer can’t treat you differently from other workers just because you are pregnant. The Supreme Court just decided a case where they clarified what this means. The Court said that employers may not put a “significant burden” on pregnant employees. How do you know what’s a significant burden? Start looking around at how your employer treats other non-pregnant employees who have needed an accommodation at work. For example, does your employer have a policy of giving light duty only to those with on-the-job injuries? Or did they have no problem helping out folks with non-pregnancy related disabilities, but sent all the pregnant women out onto unpaid leave? If so, this could be evidence of pregnancy discrimination. Since we are still waiting for further clarification of how this standard works, it’s best to collect all the evidence you can (policies, employee handbooks or manuals, digging around to find out how others have been treated) and to discuss your particular situation with an attorney.

" Q: Was fired from my company less than 24 hours after disclosing my pregnancy to HR.
T: BAD
B: Sorry if this is kind of long! I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.

I've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our ""HR"" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.

December came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.

The company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss/ceo/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.

Unrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.

I have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.

","Just because the employer says ""This is a position elimination"" or ""It's not you, it's me"" doesn't mean that's actual the true motivation. The true motivation may be pregnancy. 

Shady employers target employees for illegal retaliatory firings all the time and then offer the pretext that it was a ""one person layoff"" and juries will often see right through that explanation.

The OP should talk to an employment discrimination lawyer.

&gt;He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else.

That's not a normal reason to fire someone. At all. It makes no sense. What makes sense is they fired you for being pregnant. END"

T: GOOD
B: My hometown is in central IL, USA. My mom lives there. I'm a 26 y/o PhD student in Australia, with my legal residence being in IL still. My mom sent me the jury summons, and I thought no problem, I'll tell them my situation and all will be well (especially because the same situation was true a few years ago, and that's what happened). 

The form was online, I filled out an ""excused absence request"" for reasons of secondary education. In the box asking for further information, I told them I was a PhD student at \[university\] in \[town\] in Australia. Currently residing in \[town\], Australia. Unable to travel to the USA to attend. 

Today I found out that my request was refused and I am expected to appear. I called the courthouse to which I was summoned to ask for more information, and I was told that this decision is final, and I will need to appear or face legal consequences.

Surely I'm not the only one who thinks this is totally unreasonable... but I'm not sure which steps to take next. Can someone help?

","Call the courthouse on the day you’re summoned (since you’re in Aus this will be highly inconvenient) and ask to speak to a clerk in the jury office. Explain the situation to them and that you won’t be attending. Usually the people manning the desk at the courthouse are pretty easy to deal with, and their supervisor can excuse people the day of the summons.

I live in IL and have gotten excused for less than what you’re into, though each time I simply got another summons 6 months later. END"

","If, things do not get resolved, you (obviously) won't be at your assigned date.

Keep records.  Records, records, records.  Reasonable proof that you're out of the country, reasonable proof that you're attending a foreign school, and journalistic notes regarding your attempts so resolve the situation.

Odds are that nothing will come of it -but- if there's someone at the court that's out to prove something?  Having the records will be a tremendous help when it comes to getting out of any trouble they try to get you into -whether it be a fine, or a bench warrant, or whatever else someone might concoct that thinks a student abroad (on another continent, no less) is available for their jury pool.

My brother has been dating a girl with whom he met at the restaurant where they both work (Los Angeles, CA).  He is a server while he attends college and the girl is a hostess who told him she attends another nearby college in the area.  His school is about 30 miles away so he only works weekend shifts.  The girl worked weeknights and the occasional weekend day so they were not together at the restaurant too often - I'm guessing the staff didn't know.

They have been dating about 6 months and from what he said, are sexually active.  Last night at around 9 PM, the girl and her parents came over and let's just say shit hit the fan -- the girl was bawling her eyes out, her parents were extremely loud and threatening .. it was pure chaos.

We found out the girl is only 16 years old and attends the local high school - she even had a fake ID that looked perfect to the naked eye.  They threatened to press charges for Statutory Rape and we are terrified.

I don't know what to do.  Do we go to the police first?  Or contact an attorney?  If it helps, my brother has texts from her stating her age, and her facebook says her fake birthday.

" Q: Ex-employer paid my vacation time out at $12/hour instead of $17 because they ""didn't feel comfortable""
T: GOOD
B: I'm going to try and make this as simple as possible. I live in Louisiana, and I was a retail department manager for the same company for 2 years. In the second year, I never used my vacation time and had accrued almost 30 hours. In June of 2019 I announced that I was going to drop down in my position to pursue my own personal business, but wasn't sure if I was going to drop down to a part time sales associate or a full time team lead. I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended. Well, a couple of months go by and I keep following up with my physical therapist (who I see 2x a week), and they say my policy is still active. So I keep going. I realize I wasn't paid out my vacation time, so I get back in touch with the district manager who starts looking into the issue. Turns out, I was paying for my insurance out of my vacation time for a few months, so it was never paid out in cash. She talks to the benefits department and determines they will pay me out that week. Here's the kicker, the REGIONAL manager says he doesn't feel comfortable paying me out at my $17/hour rate that I worked for 2 years because it was apparently changed in the system by my boss to $12/hour, even though I have never worked at the company for $12/hour. I have a full email conversation of the benefits department saying I needed to be paid out at my old rate, and them saying they ""aren't comfortable"". I said screw it, I don't think thats legal and theres no HR department for the company, but I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. Fast forward to now, I got a call from my psychologist saying the insurance was terminated July 28th, and I owe them $400. I also get a call from my physical therapist for the same reason, saying I owe them $1800. I have proof from my ADP (payroll company) log in, that I had paid for the insurance out of my vacation time through November. But it doesn't matter since it was reported as cancelled in July.

The major question is, what can I do? Do I just say screw it and pay it or fight my previous employer?

Fast forward to now, I got a call from my psychologist saying the insurance was terminated July 28th, and I owe them $400. I also get a call from my physical therapist for the same reason, saying I owe them $1800. I have proof from my ADP (payroll company) log in, that I had paid for the insurance out of my vacation time through November. But it doesn't matter since it was reported as cancelled in July.

The major question is, what can I do? Do I just say screw it and pay it or fight my previous employer?

" Q: Ex-employer paid my vacation time out at $12/hour instead of $17 because they ""didn't feel comfortable""
T: BAD
B: I'm going to try and make this as simple as possible. I live in Louisiana, and I was a retail department manager for the same company for 2 years. In the second year, I never used my vacation time and had accrued almost 30 hours. In June of 2019 I announced that I was going to drop down in my position to pursue my own personal business, but wasn't sure if I was going to drop down to a part time sales associate or a full time team lead. I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended. Well, a couple of months go by and I keep following up with my physical therapist (who I see 2x a week), and they say my policy is still active. So I keep going. I realize I wasn't paid out my vacation time, so I get back in touch with the district manager who starts looking into the issue. Turns out, I was paying for my insurance out of my vacation time for a few months, so it was never paid out in cash. She talks to the benefits department and determines they will pay me out that week. Here's the kicker, the REGIONAL manager says he doesn't feel comfortable paying me out at my $17/hour rate that I worked for 2 years because it was apparently changed in the system by my boss to $12/hour, even though I have never worked at the company for $12/hour. I have a full email conversation of the benefits department saying I needed to be paid out at my old rate, and them saying they ""aren't comfortable"". I said screw it, I don't think thats legal and theres no HR department for the company, but I didn't want to add fuel to the fire.

" Q: Who is responsible for paying professional cleaning/hazmat cleanup fees when a tenant dies? - Illinois/Chicago
T: GOOD
B: A relative of mine recently passed away in her apartment. It had been several days (if not more) since her death before anyone discovered her, so her apartment is in need of professional cleaning to handle issues related to a dead body being on the floor for some time.  My parents are currently trying to work out all of the death-related issues with the landlord, but money is tight and they are worried that they will end up having to pay an expensive cleaning fee.  My relative was the sole occupant and lessee of the premises. I currently do not have any more information about her lease. 

My gut instinct is that the landlord is responsible for cleanup because it seems to me that the landlord bears the risk of a tenant dying on the premises when it leases it out to individuals, and a proper cleanup will enable the landlord to begin leasing the property to a new tenant. But, that could be totally wrong.  Generally speaking, are landlords responsible for paying professional cleaning fees when a tenant dies in the premises? Or, are the relatives of the deceased responsible?

" Q: How to dispose of firearms owned by felon family member currently in prison? [Georgia]
T: GOOD
B: Hello. Bit of a back story here but 

A few years ago, my dad was arrested for some pretty serious crimes and was bailed out a few days after. As I was a minor then, I was taken by CPS and sent to live with my mom and stepdad. During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. 

He took all of his stuff and any thing I didn’t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn’t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)

His dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he’d stop paying it. That’s fine with me as I have no contact with my dad and have been meaning to cut my name off his stuff but hey, life happens. I decided recently that I’d go through it and get my stuff and just let the storage place auction the rest. Opened it up after not seeing it in years, and there’s two firearms. 

There’s no telling if they’re registered (I’m pretty sure he bought them off Craigslist or something similar) or even legal in any capacity. One is a pistol and another is some kind of automatic rifle. Not sure. Don’t know much about guns. I didn’t touch them or the bullet cartridges with them. My sister was with me and touched them to see if they were real. 

I closed it, locked it, and called my stepdad to ask what to do. He told me to tell the people that own the units, my mom says go to police since my dad is technically a felon (he’s still in prison for another decade plus) and my sister (paranoid ex drug addict) says we should just leave them and I need to forget my stuff in there because “the cops will make it look like we own them illegally” (taking that with a grain of salt)

So. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what would happen if the people go to auction it and see the guns like fucking loaded and if they’ll contact me or what. But I am completely unsure of what to do here. Any advice is seriously appreciated. For what it matters I’m currently 19 and my sister is 21. 

Edit: as far as selling/keeping the guns, I’m not interested in keeping them and know absolutely nothing about gun safety and/or transactions. 

Also think I should mention that the pistol has a homemade silencer on it. It’s one of those giant flashlights hollowed out. I remember him making it when we lived together but I thought he got rid of everything after being arrested.

As far as I know, they were never used in the commission of a crime. He’s ex-military and we lived in the countryside so there was always guns in the house. His felony charges are sex offender related

###

","There is no registration in Georgia for firearms. There is federal registration for NFA items (basically silencers, machine guns and sawn off rifles and shotguns). While it it technically possible you have an actual ""automatic rife"" its far more likely to be a semi-auto rifle and thus does not need registration.

","NAL, but I am very well acquainted with the NFA.

Ok, the Edit really changes the ball game. Before the edit I would have said to find a friend that does know something about firearms, get them to make sure they are unloaded and then assess selling them to a reputable gun store.

Now that you have said there is a most likely an illegal NFA device this completely changes. Do not touch them, do not let the storage unit go to auction. Immediately contact the police non-emergency line and explain you need to meet an officer at the storage place and that you have most likely found illegal items owned by your felon father who is currently in prison. Meet them promptly and explain (be kind and courteous) that the items are emphatically NOT yours and that they are your fathers and were unaware of them until now. Let them examine and remove the items. Regardless of whether they search the rest for the storage locker or not, ask one of the officers for a card and ask them if you can contact them if you find anything else that might be illegal. END"

" Q: Business Next Door Installed High Powered Lights That Shine and Blink into my Home
T: GOOD
B: The day I went on a trip for the holidays a dog training center that moved in next door this past year, installed new super bright LED lights that shine into my house.  We had emailed them immediately that we need to come to an arrangement where the lights are angled differently - they appear on a hinge.

Then we were gone for the holidays.  As soon as we walk in the house upon our return, we realize that they have another light installed and this one blinks.

http://imgur.com/a/BXI6RmE (gif of the lights)

I walked over to the business and asked if they could turn off the lights, as we just got home from a trip.  The worker said that we must be tired, but she would call and see if she was allowed.  We left.  Lights remained on - as they are set to a timer.

I have emailed the business asking for them to call me in the morning.  

My best case scenario is that they angle the lights differently so they don't shine in my house anymore.  This is my optimistic, best case plan.

What other options could I have, if polite discourse doesn't work?

Edit: I'm in Texas

Update 1: I sent three emails to the owner, one including the video shown above.  They have a maintenance man who adjusting one of the three lights at 8am this morning.  He angled the one blinking light downward slightly.  I am curious how it will appear tonight.

Update 2: http://imgur.com/a/KbSrd00
They installed hoods on 2 of the 3 lights.  And adjusted the angle on the 1 blinking light.  They are attempting quick progress.

" Q: Partner almost died from ectopic pregnancy after two missed diagnosis at the ER
T: GOOD
B: I’m likely going to provide more detail then necessary here but I could really use advice on if we have any case here, as the whole thing was traumatic and we’re in financial trouble because of it.


In early January 2019, my parter was having some pain in her abdomen but wasn’t sure what was going on. She finally decided to go to urgent care, where they determined she was pregnant. They had suspicious of an ectopic pregnancy due to the pain, thus they sent her to the ER to be further evaluated. 

When went to the closest ER where they ran the routine test on her, including a pregnancy test, ultra sound, and general examination. There was nothing abnormal found and we thought she was just having a rough pregnancy, we went home excited but nervous because she was still in pain.

The next evening rolled around and she was still in a lot of pain, it was actually getting worse. We went back to the same ER, explained the situation from the night prior and they conducted the same tests and concluded that she was just pregnant and needed an appointment with her OBGYN ASAP. So again, we left with my partner still in pain. 

We made an appointment with the OBGYN for the next day and my partner went to the appointment. It may be important to add that this doctor is in the same hospital where the emergency room was located. After a quick examination, the OBGYN determined that she suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and was experiencing internal bleeding. She was rushed into surgery within the hour to save her life. 

Fortunately, she has recovered since the incident however we are still strapped with medical debt from both ER visits, the OBGYN and the surgery. It’s not that we’re opposed to paying for the services but feel as if we are entitled to some reprieve and even compensation , given the two missed diagnosis and the almost fatal fallout from them. 

Is there any possibility that we have a case against the hospital or at least legs to stand on to ask for a reprieve from the charges?

We are located in Richmond, Virginia. 

Thank you for reading, please let me know if any additional information is needed.

","You would have to demonstrate that the misdiagnosis was unreasonable. Misdiagnoses happen all the time that, while incorrect, are not unreasonable. Did they misinterpret the tests? Were there other tests that they should have done? Etc. You generally prove this through expert evidence.

The other issue is what injuries they caused you. You mention the ER debt, the OBGYN, and the surgery. Even if the ER doctor(s) did misdiagnose her, they may not have caused her to have to see an OBGYN and have surgery. That may very well have happened anyway (i.e. had the first ER doctor picked up on the ectopic pregnancy, she still may have incurred those OBGYN/surgery costs). You may be able to prove that had the first doctor caught it, you could have taken medication to end the pregnancy rather than requiring surgery, but this option may not have been available in your case (in other words, she still may have required surgery). In short, you aren't going to get money for health care costs that you would have incurred anyway to treat the ectopic pregnancy. However, if you are able to argue that the first ER doctor was unreasonable in failing to diagnose her condition, you may be able to recover the cost of the second ER visit (because it would have been unnecessary had the first doctor properly identified her condition). But that all hinges on the doctors being unreasonable and not just mistaken.

You aren't entitled to compensation for the ""almost fatal fallout"". An almost injury is not compensable.

" Q: Partner almost died from ectopic pregnancy after two missed diagnosis at the ER
T: BAD
B: I’m likely going to provide more detail then necessary here but I could really use advice on if we have any case here, as the whole thing was traumatic and we’re in financial trouble because of it.


In early January 2019, my parter was having some pain in her abdomen but wasn’t sure what was going on. She finally decided to go to urgent care, where they determined she was pregnant. They had suspicious of an ectopic pregnancy due to the pain, thus they sent her to the ER to be further evaluated. 

When went to the closest ER where they ran the routine test on her, including a pregnancy test, ultra sound, and general examination. There was nothing abnormal found and we thought she was just having a rough pregnancy, we went home excited but nervous because she was still in pain.

The next evening rolled around and she was still in a lot of pain, it was actually getting worse. We went back to the same ER, explained the situation from the night prior and they conducted the same tests and concluded that she was just pregnant and needed an appointment with her OBGYN ASAP. So again, we left with my partner still in pain. 

We made an appointment with the OBGYN for the next day and my partner went to the appointment. It may be important to add that this doctor is in the same hospital where the emergency room was located. After a quick examination, the OBGYN determined that she suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and was experiencing internal bleeding. She was rushed into surgery within the hour to save her life. 

Fortunately, she has recovered since the incident however we are still strapped with medical debt from both ER visits, the OBGYN and the surgery. It’s not that we’re opposed to paying for the services but feel as if we are entitled to some reprieve and even compensation , given the two missed diagnosis and the almost fatal fallout from them. 

Is there any possibility that we have a case against the hospital or at least legs to stand on to ask for a reprieve from the charges?

We are located in Richmond, Virginia. 

Thank you for reading, please let me know if any additional information is needed.

" Q: Can I be forced to work if there is a snake unaccounted for in the office? (Non-US)
T: GOOD
B: As a heads up this happened in Australia, so yes there are snakes around this time of year, yes they do come inside, and yes there's the possibility it could actually hurt me and it's not just someone's pet python that was ""set free"".

I work for the IT department of a medium sized company. The nature of my job means I can do most of it from either the office or at home with the proviso that I need to be able to physically come in if there is a critical user issue that needs to be resolved urgently. Mostly I work in the office on weekdays, at home/on call on weekends on a rolling shift system with one other guy.

Yesterday afternoon I was in the office when another employee on my floor saw a snake in the male toilet/change rooms. We are on the ground floor and it is summer here so I have no reason to disbelieve this. The toilets were closed and the guy's manager tried to call a snake catcher but couldn't find one who could attend before close of business, he also checked the toilet again before the end of the day and said he couldn't see the snake but he would still arrange for one to come in on Monday morning just to check the area and make sure it isn't hanging around. His theory is that it must have came in and left through the window above the toilet (or that the guy who reported it is crazy).

I am rostered on call out duty this weekend and I do not feel comfortable going into the office on my own until the snake catcher has been in. I know it is unlikely I will be called in but Murphy's Law says this will be the one time it actually happens. Can I legally refuse on personal safety grounds without being reprimanded?

###

","From Australia, not legally qualified.

I think you have the safety angle to lean on for not coming in, if you're the only one in the building.

Just because the boss says ""I didn't see the snake, it must have left"" isn't good enough for WHS. Until an expert who knows where to look and what to look for has had a chance to clear the building, there is still a chance the snake is still in there.

However, if there are at least two people there together, then you can still come in and do your job - so long as it doesn't involve blindly reaching into dark spaces. Someone else in the building isn't good enough because the second person needs to be there to watch your back while you're focussed on your job and to call an ambulance if you do get bitten.

However, most snakes will actively avoid people, so if you were on your own and noisy, odds are you'd be able to work on your own without issue.

The sticking point is ""without reprimand"". If your boss is the type to make you go in to an area where a snake might be against your better judgement then odds are they're the type to try and write you up for not saying ""bless you"" after they sneezed. END"

","What state are you in? The specifics of each OH&amp;S act vary by state. 

That said I believe the risk to yourself is extremely minor and would probably be assessed as such by WorkSafe, I highly doubt they'd shut down your building because of one snake siting. The majority of snake strikes are caused by either people stumbling into them or people trying to mess with a snake they know about already. 

If you make plenty of noise, say by stomping around when you go into the office and playing music any snake is going to leave. Don't go into any crawl spaces and have a look under your desk when you get in to make sure nothings asleep under there and you'll be fine.

" Q: My employer deducted pension contributions from my paycheck, but never remitted them to the state, causing my account to expire and loss of privileges. (NJ)
T: GOOD
B: This is a bit specific.  I am not necessarily looking for answers about the ins and outs of the state pension system, but more for what legal liability my employer might have for the ramifications this is causing.  

I am public school teacher in NJ.  I had 5 years of service before I started with my former school in early 2017. They took 15 months to complete the intrafund transfer with much pestering from me (already ridiculous.)  Inactive pension accounts expire after two years.  Right before this time period was up (June 2018) the transfer went through.  I received certification from the state that the transfer was completed with a date of March 2017 (so I was only actually inactive for 8 months) and that my deductions and 15 months of back deductions would begin in June 2018.  From that date on, the deductions were coming out of each paycheck, in the correct amounts, under line items clearly denoting pension contribution and back pension contribution. 

I left that school this past June and took a job at in a different district for September.  At that point, I thought my biggest issue was waiting for another transfer and making sure I was putting money aside for the 2 remaining back payments, plus the back payments i would have to make after the transfer went through.  In October, the payroll department alerted me to the fact that they were having difficulty because they couldn't find an account in my name.  It seems that even though I was making these contributions, the state wasn't receiving them.  My account expired.  The state most likely sent a notice to a previous address.  I have had to enroll in new account.  Expired accounts lose all rights and privileges connected to that account - I've lost my tier, my retirement is pushed back, and I would have to purchase 7.5 years of service credits at much higher rates.  I was 1.5 years from being vested, now I'm 9 years.  

My former employer has been completely unhelpful and incompetent over the past three months as I have tried to get answers from them.  In November, HR told me that the accountant had found the discrepancy and was working with the state to fix it.  After a few more weeks of radio silence, I tried to follow up by CCing a higher up, who CC'd other higher ups, and their replies make it clear they don't understand the situation at all.  Obviously, I will continue to push for answers.  Where did my money go?  Where did THEIR required 3% employer contribution go?  Participation for the teacher pension fund in NJ is NOT optional.   I will try and appeal the expiration of my account with the state.  However, if that cannot be undone, then I feel that the my former employer owes me the money they took from my paychecks, the 3% they were supposed to contribute over 28 months, payment for my service credits, and whatever is fair damages for pushing back my retirement (loss of tier). Could I successfully sue them for these damages?

Is this legal, I was a minor when it happened, so why would it go into my account or should I take some sort of legal action against the creditors. I'm sorry I don't know about this stuff due to only being 18 years old.

" Q: Mother taken advantage of by travel agent for $50,000 (MN/FL)
T: GOOD
B: In September of 2019, my mother and an old friend  she recently reconnected with who both live in Minnesota traveled to Spain and France for two weeks. My mother informed the travel agent she wanted to spend no more than between $6,000-$10,000 total for the trip. My Mother's friend agreed she didn't want to spend more than $5,000 for her portion. My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent. My mother was told the only expenses she would owe for their stays would be cleaning fees and that she would cover the security deposits. All other costs of the trip were to be equally split between my mother and her friend. 

After reviewing my Mother's accounts over Christmas, I realized a third-party company, on behalf of a travel agent my mother used, has charged my mother more than $50,000 total between her credit card and checking account beginning from before her trip, right up until the end of December. The travel agent is unable to provide invoices for the majority of the $50,000 charged to this third-party company. I was informed that because my mother’s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother’s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. 

The travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. 

The travel agent gained access to my mother’s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. 

The travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.

The travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother’s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. 

I have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  

My main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? 

Apologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. 

TL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances. The charges are being disputed via her bank, but the bank doesn't know if they will be refunded to my mother. What are her chances if she choses to civilly sue?

T: GOOD
B:  I am watching my sibling die/descend into madness and I feel like there is nothing I can do to stop it. I need help understanding if there are any actions I can take in this situation.

My sibling is bipolar and has not accepted any treatment since we've found out. She has been on a steep decent for the last \~2 years. Here's a brief glimpse of what she's done. Please let me know if I should go into more detail:

&amp;#x200B;

Filling in the picture:

* Hasn't been able to hold a job for 2 years. Has gotten lots of funding from friends and family.
* Will not entertain any conversation about her health
* Has moved a dozen times. SF, Michigan, LA, Pennsylvania, etc.
* Has gotten mugged 3 times (in one of these she had her car stolen and didn't report it)
* Is sometimes delusional: ""Last week I saw Donald Trump, Putin, and Morgan Freeman walking in San Francisco""
* Punched her landlord (no charges filed)
* Has repeatedly harassed old coworkers and announced intent to hurt them
   * Got a restraining order filed against her from old coworker
   * Emailed: ""I have strong desires for all kinds of violence against myself and personal property of others""
   * Told a coworker she wants to ""light them up""
* purchased and moved into a total junker 26' sailboat and started trying to live anchored out in the Saucalito Bay
   * When my mom and other sister tried to show up to talk to her about moving off the boat and getting into an apartment she punched my sister in a Rite Aid (no charges filed... maybe something we can still do here?)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've tried to do in the past:**

* Called the police to report that she punched my sister and relayed her violent messages to coworkers:
   * Police response: ""This is a minor misdemeanor. For us to act on a psychiatric emergency she needs to say ""I want to kill myself/I want to kill someone""
* Called in to have a wellness check done #1 after she threatened coworker
   * Result: She was able to put up a front of ""im fine"" for police
* Called in to have a wellness check done #2 after she punched landlord
   * She was taken to the hospital, was unsupervised, and walked out

&amp;#x200B;

**Most recently, she's in LA and just announced:**

* Her intent to buy and try heroin
* Her intent to buy a gun
* Her intent to hurt a coworker who won't return calls: That she would ""Light them up""

**Right now:**

* I'm ***extremely*** worried about doing heroin. I think she could and would absolutely do it, and I think it would be the start of the next extremely deep descent.
* I believe she needs to be hospitalized/committed, but:
   * She's never said outright ""I want to kill myself/I want to kill someone"" (*extremely* unlikely she will say this outright while police are around. She always puts on a face with police.)
   * Will never accept treatment willingly
* I am afraid of taking an action that will make her angry and disappear again
* My faith in the police being helpful is extremely low. It seems like she has to be an inch from death before she can be helped.

&amp;#x200B;

There is much much more context to all this. Please let me know if any more info about the situation would be helpful. What can I do?

I'll try to be as detailed as possible: my current job requires me to check-in through security then walk approximately 10 minutes outdoors to another building in order to get to my assigned work station, during this time I am on company property under company rules (no phones, food [clarified:must be in clear or sealed packaging], electronic devices, etc).

During this time I am not allowed to clock in until I get to the main building. I was told during orientation for this job that I will have to get to work at least 10 minutes early each day in order to avoid being late for work. This is a major US logistics corporation with very stingy management.

According to the Department of Labor website, ""In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work.""

I asked for $297 (half price of shoes, cost of repair, cost to file). During the trial, the judge asked us to try to settle so that we might both be happy. The defendant yelled out $150. I agreed on this. The judge had me give my address to the defendant for the check. I haven’t received it. I’ve called their business, texted, no response until today from a receptionist at the business to call their lawyer. What are they planning? What can I do?
This is in New York State. Thank you!

Edit: it has been exactly 30 days since the trial and judgement.

You have a judgement in your favor, you can move forward with trying to collect using the methods provided to you by the state of New York.  Stop listening to the defendants about lawyers they've retained or appeals they want to file or whatever -- they clearly want you to not collect, so moving forward with attempting to collect is the way to go.

A lawyer and and appeal may pop up during your attempts at collecting.  If they do, address those then, but assume that neither exist until they do. END"

" Q: Fighting with no contact parents over my bank account
T: GOOD
B: When my parents kicked me out at 18, they had a bank account with both mine and their names that had my money in it. I went to make my own account in the same bank and asked the bank to transfer that money into it. They refused and told me that they needed authorization from my parents, as their name was also on the account, and it didn’t matter that I was 18. Then I got some advice from a redditor that said that was bullshit, and it’s my money and that if I go to an atm I can transfer it to my account, so I did. 

Now I’ve received an email from my bank that says I need to call them in regards to that account. I checked my mobile app a few days later and there’s negative $6, probably from my parents making an enquiry or something. Now there’s $.01 in it. What should I do? Can I get in trouble or be reported for stealing my own money somehow? I live in New York State. 


EDI Bank called again twice so I picked up. They seem a little confused and basically said “you shouldn’t have been able to do that”, and that they want me to put the money back in the savings account so there isn’t legal trouble. As they explained, it is totally my money and is supposed to go to me, but the “custodian” of my bank account has to be the one giving it to me. According to their own regulations, there is no automatic age limit where the money totally becomes mine. I could be 50. But they say “most custodians transfer it over by 18 or 21.” Okay but my mom’s a shit head and won’t do that, and apparently never has to do that, even though they agree it’s my own money. I just can’t access it. I refused to transfer the money back and told them to call my mom to discuss her changing her custodian status to give me full control over the account, but I’m not sure if she’ll comply. I’m waiting for a reply now. I’m not rich enough to “hit the gym and lawyer up” and I don’t fancy a couple years of legal battles for what little money is in that account, but what options/laws do I have? I’m in the right here aren’t I?

","Also, have your name removed from the original account once it's zeroed out so if your parents overdraw you are not legally liable for any charges / payments on it.

FWIW, the bank is siding with your parents presumably because they have other accounts there and they don't want to lose them as a customer.  Laugh in their face and/or tell them to pound sand anytime they pressure you into returning your own money into an account you do not control. END"

T: GOOD
B: We had a Company Holiday Party, and a fellow employee (who I did not know) walked out with my jacket an hour before I left.

The company has camera footage of him leaving with my jacket.

When they brought it up to him. He said the jacket was in a friend's car, but later ""recalled"" that he left it at Friday's and called them to get it back. He was able to return my jacket and keys but the wallet was gone. The wallet had approximately $380 worth of Cash/Gift Cards (it was right before Christmas).

What are the steps I need to do? 

Should I file a police report? Do they help me recover the value of what was lost?

Do I ask him to give me the money directly?

Do I have to take him to court? What would I need to do this? A police report? The footage from the party?

" Q: Boyfriend's ankle monitor breaks or malfunctions so often. His new job is in jeopardy. [MA]
T: GOOD
B: My boyfriend has a GPS ankle monitor and a midnight-5AM curfew. He's been doing everything right but the thing breaks or stops working roughly every 2 weeks. We keep getting calls from his PO that he has to visit the nearest court asap for a replacement. He's on his third monitor in less than a month. He just started a new job and we're worried how much this is really affecting his life. He keeps getting pulled out of work, or we're woken up at 4 am by frantic phone calls.

My general question is, is there a period of good behavior he can show to a judge that may one day get it removed, or are bail conditions set in stone until the case is over? More specifically, is this normal to have so much issues with an ankle monitor?

###

","If your boyfriend is on bail and the ankle monitor is a condition of his bail he should bend over backward to do whatever his PO tells him. 

I can’t say why the ankle monitors he’s using are so prone to malfunction or breaking, but technology is prone to wear and tear as just about anything is. It sounds like his PO is working with him to keep him within the conditions of his bail or probation by arranging for it to be replaced ASAP. 

I would gather also that there is possibly something interfering with the signal itself the device is sending or receiving. Do you also have trouble using a cell phone from inside the house, or are you all using a blanket with metal or wiring in it? 

GPS signals are very weak and be blocked by just roofs or walls. Just something to consider. END"

","This is something you'll need to get ahead of then. Tell the PO that you believe the basement may be interfering with the GPS signal. Ask them if they can provide a base station that can be hooked up to the internet or boost the signal.

Just from perusing google this is not an uncommon problem, these ankle monitors malfunctioning or not being able to send a signal, or in worse cases, reporting that the trackee is elsewhere than they should be.

As others have said, definitely talk with your lawyer if you have one and explain the situation you are having. Talk with the PO as well, and if you know the name of the company who does the actual monitoring (I'm almost positive they've probably outsourced this), call them up and explain the problem you're having and see if you have any recourse as well.

The worst possible thing you can do is ""wait and see"" in this case. Be proactive. Answer every call from your PO. Change your sleeping area if possible to allow for better signal. If this ends up in front of a judge and you haven't been prompt or diligent about reporting issues or switching out of equipment, it will reflect badly on you.

So yeah, talk to PO, talk to your lawyer who handled or is handling your case and make them both aware of the difficulties you're having. Depending on the charges and conditions of your probation, they may try to change the conditions of your bail to account for the difficulties, but if not, this will probably be one of them ""grin and bear it"" moments in life.

" Q: Landlady made us move to remodel, wants us to pay for things we haven't damaged, &amp; plans to send more bills past the 21-day window
T: GOOD
B: In California, Contra Costa County.

Husband &amp; I lived in a condo for almost 4 years til our landlady sent a move-out notice so she could fully remodel and put her family in the unit.  The only damage left when we moved was one broken mirrored sliding closet door and a 5-inch crack in the shower enclosure. The shower crack was there when we moved in but unfortunately it wasn't documented.  Mind you, the lease specified this shower couldn't be cleaned with anything but liquid soap, as anything else strips the cheap caulking and lining.

We never got a copy of the condition report when we moved in.  We requested a pre-moveout inspection that she conducted, but she didn't give us a physical itemized statement with the required Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2) language.  Instead, she texted an itemized list, including ""dusty patio; dust in drawers; dust in refrigerator"". It's my understanding those things can’t be on the list as they're normal wear and tear and can't be deducted from the deposit.

After moving out, she sent us a physical itemized list with two estimates--one replacing the entire shower enclosure, and the other replacing 3 mirrored sliding closet doors.  Someone from Home Depot signed the sliding door estimate, saying that they do not install single door panels. The itemized list said that the total we owe against our security deposit was ""TBD"" (to be determined).  Is the remaining life of an item supposed to be considered when calculating repair cost? I contacted her multiple times asking when the shower and sliding doors were initially installed, but she wouldn’t respond.

Tomorrow will be 21 days from when we vacated the premises.  Last night, she sent us an email with the 'current total' we owe, saying that we owe the full cost of replacing all 3 sliding closet doors as she's given us opportunity to repair them ourselves but we haven't done so.  She also says she'll send us her receipts within 14 days after she obtains them, and claims that the shower repair must first be approved by the HOA that doesn't meet until later this or next month.

None of this seems legal, especially considering how she violated Civil Code 1950.5(f)(2).  I went through our lease and discovered she didn't complete the ""Condition of Premises"" section where she was supposed to ""check all that apply"", including the claim that tenants agreed to the specified condition.  The only thing checked was an item specifying the shower not be cleaned with anything but liquid soap.

Are we liable for the full replacement cost of items if they were not new when we moved in?  Is she required to calculate the cost with consideration to the remaining life of the item(s)?  Is she allowed to bill us the full cost to replace 3 sliding doors when only 1 was damaged? Can she send us another bill in a month for the shower, which she thinks we're supposed to pay full cost to repair?  Our lease says that all parties involved must mediate first in the event of dispute. If she doesn't send us a valid estimate amount tomorrow, can we demand that she mediate as she's not made a good faith effort to be fair or follow the laws as specified?  I’m at my wits end with this lady.

###

","Contact an attorney and see if one will spend an hour talking to you. Texting likely isn’t proper notice, and TBD isn’t a valid cost. You’re likely going to have a good argument for not paying.

" Q: 70 year old Dad wants me (M 37) to take guardianship of his newborn
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway account. Backstory: I'm 37 and recently married with no kids but my wife and I would like to start a family  soon.

My Dad (70) and Stepmom (55) just had a child (using in-vitro). It was a surprise to the rest of the family but clearly an intentional decision on their part.

She doesn't have any other family and my dad doesn't have any siblings. My brother (35) and I are his only family.   He keeps trying to tell me that I need to ""step up"" for the family and take guardianship of my new half-sister. But this seems like a pretty big decision given how old they both are.

I love my father very much but he is not in great health and it's unlikely he will live until 88 when the child is of legal age. My stepmom is in better health but does not have great employment prospects so I'm worried that even if she lives, there wont be enough money.

What exactly does guardianship entail legally and what can I do to protect myself before responding. They live in MD. We live in DC. I'm worried that this is pretty big ask to make to my wife at the start of our marriage. I haven't agreed to anything so welcome any and all advice and follow up questions.

Update (for clarity): He's asked to take ""guardianship"" only if something happens to both of them, so not while they're both alive. But given their advanced age this feels like a possible scenario before the child turns 18.

###

","None of this story seems to make sense.  It’s hard to imagine a fertility clinic creating this pregnancy in these two people.  And almost impossible to imagine someone making the financial investment in IVF only to turn around and seek to immediately hand that child off to someone else.  

What is it your father wants to accomplish?  Is it your assistance?  Or is it your raising the child as your own?  

There are a number of approaches you could take to giving care to your father’s child.  One could be you maintaining custodial care of that child without a change in parental rights.  Another might be your father and stepmother relinquishing their parental rights and you adopting the child.  If you’re interested in doing one of those you should strongly consider speaking with an attorney. END"

I'm worried that this is pretty big ask to make to my wife at the start of our marriage. I haven't agreed to anything so welcome any and all advice and follow up questions.

Update (for clarity): He's asked to take ""guardianship"" only if something happens to both of them, so not while they're both alive. But given their advanced age this feels like a possible scenario before the child turns 18.

","&gt; He keeps trying to tell me that I need to ""step up"" for the family and take guardianship of my new half-sister.

He can tell you a lot of things. What you decide to do is up to you.

""Guardianship"" as it were can be a number of things from simply being long-term babysitters to full adoption. If you want to take this on you should have the terms and any support outlined very clearly, and preferably with legal counsel.

You have no legal requirement to do anything to support the child that your father decided to conceive in his advanced age. END"
" Q: 70 year old Dad wants me (M 37) to take guardianship of his newborn
T: BAD
B: Throwaway account. Backstory: I'm 37 and recently married with no kids but my wife and I would like to start a family  soon.

My Dad (70) and Stepmom (55) just had a child (using in-vitro). It was a surprise to the rest of the family but clearly an intentional decision on their part.

She doesn't have any other family and my dad doesn't have any siblings. My brother (35) and I are his only family.   He keeps trying to tell me that I need to ""step up"" for the family and take guardianship of my new half-sister. But this seems like a pretty big decision given how old they both are.

I love my father very much but he is not in great health and it's unlikely he will live until 88 when the child is of legal age. My stepmom is in better health but does not have great employment prospects so I'm worried that even if she lives, there wont be enough money.

" Q: I have been falsely accused of ""drugging"" someone. I need real help!
T: GOOD
B: Edit: I already have  CDA, but apparently need a new one that I won't be able to afford because Ill lose my current retainer.

I was hanging out with a girl before going to a show. We had discussed and previously chatted about doing MDMA before going. she said she had experience in using it before. 

She was a nurse and was worried about a drug test. So she would not smoke weed, but did not mind doing cocaine or MDMA because they leave your system so quickly. 

The night of the show she comes over, but little did I know she had not eaten anything or drank anything all day. She did not smoke anything, just took a small amount of pure MDMA. maybe .1 g... maybe less.

It hits her like a train on an empty stomach, she says she needs to go home, on the way home she tells the uber driver to take her to the hospital bc she does not feel good. He can't, pulls over and calls 911 for liability reasons. 

She goes to the hospital and is fine, just dehydrated... Tests positive for MDMA and nothing else. Freaks out because she is up for her Nursing boards AND had custody of her kid (I didn't even know that part) and threw me under the bus, saying she didn't know she took it. She testified in the hearing that I put it in a blunt and we smoked it. That I secretly sprinkled MDMA in a blunt and we smoked it. Though her tox reports show no Marijuana AND the science behind taking a flame to a salt like drug like MDMA will destroy the product rendering the chemicals useless, basically you can't smoke MDMA in a blunt or joint...

She also tried to claim after smoking the MDMA she became basically mute and lost the ability to express she wanted to leave. That she had no control over her body.... after smoking a blunt with MDMA....

What is the kind of expert I need to testify something like this? 

Honestly, I don't even know where to start, and cannot believe this is going to trial even based on the simple science behind the ""victims"" testimony....

","Just saying that the accuser has contradicted a toxicology report. Any charges will be difficult to prosecute as a result, as a medical professional will state the accuser should have had other substances in their system, and the statement is likely inaccurate. (That's a much better situation than, say, the accuser showing up at the police station the next day saying other things without a toxicology report.)  
OP states the accuser made the statement in a ""hearing."" If there's been a formal hearing, OP'd likely have been arrested/charged or at least police would have attempted an interview by now. I'm also assuming OP didn't admit to buying or trafficking the MDMA if/when an interview/statement did occur.  
Location was omitted, but is important. Jurisdictions view and treat marijuana very differently and may just disregard that aspect of the case.If OP has committed a number of other crimes (i.e. has a house full of drugs) - they should probably very much worry about that, but that's not within the context of the question. In terms of worry, this specific incident is not worth hanging yourself over. Apologies if that wasn't clear.

" Q: Locksmith and electrician lurking in my apartment (Massachusetts)
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway account 

My apartment has the circuit breakers for all of th and units in my building.

I received an email yesterday night from the property manager to let me know that another unit was having an electrical issue and they needed an electrician to come into my apartment to see the circuit breaker. They also told me that the key they have for my unit wasn't working, so they were sending a locksmith. 

I'm currently on vacation and received a notification from my security cameras of a man walking around my kitchen and living room for about 8 minutes.  I've since found out that this was the locksmith, which is unsettling because you need to go up a flight of stairs from my front door to get into my kitchen and living room- so there shouldn't have been any reason why he was there. 

Additionally, 15 minutes after he left, I was able to see that the electrician showed up. I also saw him rummaging around my kitchen. In the footage, I also see him go into my bedroom for a few minutes. 

The property managers were not present with either third party while they were in my apartment. Additionally, it wasn't until after I moved in that I was notified that all of the units' circuit breakers are in my apartment. 


1. What grounds do I have to terminate my lease without penalty? If I am able to, would I be able to seek moving costs and brokerage fee?
2. Am I able to press charges for breaking and entering? They had permission from the property management but should not have been in my living room, bedroom, or kitchen. 


I'm still on vacation and am not able to see whether anything was stolen. Pretty rattled, so any advice would be appreciate. 


Thanks

",It's a 'no' on both of your questions. You have no damages and no legal basis for breaking your lease without penalty. The electrician/locksmith had permission to enter your unit (not breaking and entering).

","Thanks for your detailed response. Some clarifications:
1) I've since found out that he didn't need to change the lock. He just needed to test that the building had the right key. The key worked, so I don't see how he should have been in my apartment at all, let alone upstairs for 5-10 minutes. 
2) the electrician has been in my apartment many times and knows where the breaker is (right at the top of the stairs). 

My hope is that nothing is missing but won't be sure until I get home. I sent screenshots of the footage to the landlords. I am currently using 3G internet, so uploading actual videos is difficult but will review it with them when I get back. END"

","If he's got the lock in his hand, he doesn't need to go back down until it's time to put it back in the door.

If he's re-pinning it, he's got to take off a small c-clip, which takes a tool, and he'll need a tray to hold the clip. Then he has to get a follower (another tool) and push out the cylinder. The cylinder will contain 10 pins and 5 springs, all of which have to be kept on the tray. They're very small and very easy to lose. He'll likely use tweezers to put everything in place. Doesn't take as long as it seems for people who know how to do it though.

This would be true if he's taking it apart to see what's wrong as well. Same process. He could be repairing it without changing keys.

You need a table to work at to get it done, and kitchen tables/counters tend to be relatively clear compared to coffee tables, end tables, etc. Or at least easier to work at. END"

He has never discussed any type of vacation policy and has never garnished my wages like this in the past. He did not mention that this would be occurring, I had no idea until I received my check. I live on a tight budget and to have 1/4 of a month's wages to unexpectedly disappear is...just awful, especially after the holidays.

So I walked out. I packed up everything I had purchased with my own money and was never reimbursed for (mostly bar equipment), I collected everything on my office desk and left my work keys on the desk as I walked out. The entire time the owner just sat in the office and didn't say a word. He obviously knew what was happening.

Just throws away arguably the most valuable employee in the business and for what? Because I have a family on christmas? Screw me right.

SO I guess my question is, is he legally able to withhold half of my paycheck even though I am on salary? Even though I was gone 6 days I still worked at least one day of each week in the pay period. Can I file unemployment under these circumstances even though I quit? And technically I never said ""I quit"" I just walked out without saying anything. Any advice would be appreciated.

","&gt; is he legally able to withhold half of my paycheck even though I am on salary?

Presuming you're in the US, for salaried exempt employees, an employer does not have to pay salary for days they miss of their own accord, as opposed to days the workplace is closed. This is normal and typical and how I've been paid for 30+ years. It's technically not withholding pay, because no pay was earned on that day.

If it's a crummy workplace, by all means find a better job, but it certainly sounds like what he did was normal and legal. Again, assuming US. You also would likely not be eligible for unemployment. END"

I went to my appointment and everything was going smooth until the second tooth. He broke the tooth in half. The roots are still in my jaw. He told me I would have to come back once it healed up and he will get it out. 

 I got a deductible bill in the mail for $800. It showed what my insurance covers and my deductible. Deductible was $80. I sent in my check and that was that.

About a month later I got another bill in the mail saying that the dentist actually does not cover my insurance and I have to pay the full amount. I went there to fight it and it was a different receptionist and she kept saying “I never said that” “ that wasn’t me”.  I actually had to say “I don’t care who it was, me saying “you” means your business told me they accepted my insurance “. 

In the end I walked out because I was getting pissed. I also recorded that conversation. The bill went against my credit which lowered it substantially. Is there anything I can do?

My tooth is still in my jaw.

This was in New York up in Syracuse.

","Did you check with your insurance to see if that dental practice and procedure was covered under your policy?  It's generally on the insured (read: you) to verify what's covered and where, and while many offices will check for you, that's merely a courtesy, not a guarantee, and due to the nature of changing coverage, they can be wrong.

As for the broken tooth, stuff like that sometimes happens.  Getting a second opinion on whether or not the dentist/oral surgeon did anything wrong that might have caused that would likely be one of the next steps. END"

T: GOOD
B: I'm currently in university and I have an issue that might lead to a $3000 dollar expense coming out of the pockets of me and my other housemates. And I really need help knowing what the other steps are for us because we are all broke and now the landlord is giving us a really hard time.

Story: One of our housemates has to leave and he's in a hurry so he picks someone that isn't really the best pick for the house. The terrible roommate(we'll call him Bob) breaks into the house when we all leave. While in the house he isn't on the lease until 1/1/2020. He throws a party on New Year's that starts at 11:00 pm (we know this because the police were called to the house the first time at 11) and he invites people into the house and charges them for attending the party. While at the house they trash the backyard, the front yard, and the inside of the house. The landlord is saying that we owe them at least 3000 dollars in damages because of the mess that he caused. My old housemate also didn't get his deposit because he said he didn't have the money ready(I know this was really dumb but none of us knew about this). He is already going to be evicted but my housemates and I can not afford to pay this money. What's our best course of action?

###

","Before giving specific advice (which is likely that you and your roommates pay the landlord and then sue Bob in small claims), did Bob sign a sublease or join your lease after the old roommate moved out?

You said he broke in, but if he is a legal tenant with keys to the place then it wasn't a break in.

You mentioned Bob is being evicted, which makes it sound like he was indeed a tenant.

You'll have much better luck if Bob wasn't yet on a lease and hasn't established tenancy yet by staying too long (depends where you live for length of established tenancy). END"

" Q: Owing employer missing cash in MS
T: GOOD
B: I live in Mississippi and for the past few days have been hounded over a missing cash drop. Working over night alone, I waited until another employee came in to drop the cash into the safe so they could witness for me. (have their signature also saying it was witnessed) Accounting is now saying they cant find the envelope with the cash, and that it wasn't in there at all. After receiving calls all morning keeping me awake about it, they told me they were going to playback the cameras. I let them know that was absolutely fine and even told them the exact time I placed the money in and to ask the fellow employee as he was still there. Later on, I called asking about the footage. My manager claimed it looked as if I dropped the envelope in the safe but, that accounting still didn't have it. It was then requested that I stay late this morning after my shift to have a meeting with the manager and HR about the missing drop. 

I'm worried they're going to try and force me to pay the amount back out of pocket. The amount is honestly less than $100 but enough that it would hurt with where my finances are at the moment. My question is, is it legal for them to withhold it from my check, or make me pay the amount back?

","If they have camera foootage of your deposit, it stands to reason they have footage of whatever happened around that safe afterwards, as well. Can they not see who came and used the safe after you up until the point they discovered the money missing? It sounds fishy they have an account of you putting the money in, but not what happened after that.  Ask them to do a proper investigation. Maybe whoever picked up the money dropped that particular envelope. Unless they have proof, they can't hold you liable. Agree to nothing, sign nothing, etc. I'm not a lawyer. END"

B: 
I had started a shop with 3 partners. 1 of the partners turned out to be a real pain, and he didn't want to work with us either. We will refer to this person as T. 

The investment put into the shop by me and my partner exceeded 35K$. T put in 5K$. This money went into part of the business purchase, rent, salary for 5 employees, buying expensive new tools, etc. 

Due to not having all the funds at hand (20K for taking over the lease), we paid around half the money, and the other half was due today. I was the point person for everything, including making the deals, arranging the money, creating business connects, etc. 

Because of not having all the money at once, a couple of payments to the prev leasees were delayed by 24-48 hrs.

T goes behind our backs to the prev leasees and  tells them that I'm the reason they aren't getting paid, and he has the whole money for the shop for them, they just need to kick us out.

And that's what they do. Today while I had the last payment for them, and was ready to have them sign the lease takeover (with the landlord fully in the know), they came in with the police and said they have the paperwork for this shop and that we have to go.

What do we do now? We have the entire paper trail, how everything came out of my personal bank account, or through it, how me and my partner were toiling 18 hours a day in the shop to make everything run, text messages and recordings that prove that it was me who owns the business or is the main owner of the business.

Even if the prev. Leasees don't let us keep the shop (can they do that?), don't they still have to pay money back for renovations, repairs, business expenses, salaries, all back to us?

" Q: 2 days out from moving in to grandparents house was told I (20m, IL)can no longer move in.
T: GOOD
B: My grandparents died fairly close in time around early may 2019. They had a fairly simple will stating their possessions (eg, the family farm) were to be shared in a trust between my father (the executor) and my aunt(MO) and uncle(IL). After the funeral I was told that I could stay in the house free of charge (except bills and general upkeep). I initially said I decline because I had a decent housing situation. 

Now my housing situation has changed and I asked my father and uncle if it would still be on the table if I could move in by the third. My uncle was a little dumbfounded when I asked but eventually agreed. 

So for about the last week my immediate family and I had been cleaning out the first floor of my grandparents 2 story farm house so I could move in. 

Today my uncle stops by and him and my father talk away from the rest of us to talk about what I assume I was going to cover for bills. I reassured I could pay the bills of the house and he said alright and shook my hand and left. 2 hours later my father gets a text from my uncle saying that I could no longer stay at the house and just because my father was the executor he had no power in a 2 vs 1 decision, I should also mention that the trust has not yet been started as our lawyer is slow(I assume)

My question is do I have any rights in a non-written verbal agreement and does my father having 1/3 claim to the estate give us any rights to the house to stay in and live?

###

","Assuming you're correctly citing that the will specifies the house was to be split 3 ways between your father, aunt, and uncle, your father does effectively owns 1/3 of the farmhouse.  However, that doesn't necessarily help you resolve who will get to live there.

If your aunt, uncle, and father cannot come to a living arrangements wherein the family retains possession of the house with you as a tenant, he could demand that your Aunt/Uncle buy out of his share in order to stay in the house.   
 Otherwise, they could sell the house and split the proceeds three ways.  Either way, you cannot be force your way into moving in. END"

" Q: Can my ""Step mom"" legally marry my dad while he is ""unconscious/incapacitated""?- California
T: GOOD
B: Background 1: Ive posted a lot about this before.  Dad had a stroke, he should be recovering but its going to be slow. We dont know to what point of recovery he will reach etc etc. Right now basically hes a zombie in a hospital bed due to lack of better words =.

Background 2: Dad and ""step mom"" were religiously married in India, but not legally in India or in the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to a conservator-ship attorney today and my step mom insisted on coming along.  Initially when the stroke happened (5 days ago) she was telling me not to call any lawyers and in any case she doesn't want anything regardless of what happens to my dad. Today she started asking that she wants to be on the conservator-ship. Luckily the attorney recommended since the marriage is not legal I be the sole conservator (temporary 3 month)- this is great. Then my step mom asked if there is any way for her to legalize this marriage while my father is not cognizant. Our attorney did not know, and suggested she look into it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to get spine chills here. I dont like the way this is going. Especially because with discussions with her (my dad has been an abusive person), she is still deciding what she wants to do in the outcome of this stroke. Leaving him has been mentioned. She has mentioned, see his status and then potentially leave him (is he back to normal, is he close to normal, is he mentally incapacitated, is he a vegetable).

&amp;#x200B;

Additional fact: Right now. I was told the lion's share will be going to me because I am listed as the beneficiary on his accounts. She did mention the house which is worth quite a bit would be split if the marriage is legal

&amp;#x200B;

I know so far I am only looking into conservatorship which is primarily maintaining dads finances, but her money hungriness + her discussion of potentially leaving + her asking if she can legalize the marriage without him, leaves me to this major question:

**Can my ""Step mom"" legally marry my dad while he is ""unconscious/incapacitated""?**

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want her to some how get ""in"", get control of a major set of the assets, and then jump back out.

","Re people's comments below re the possibility that the marriage will be recognized in the US, I believe the State Dept has a document that you can probably find online which outlines what constitutes a valid marriage in every country in the world (they need it for people applying for green cards, etc, based on marriage).

" Q: 17 Year-Old Sister With Eating Disorder Needs Immediate Medical Attention But Refuses to Go to Hospital
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway account. Location is Ontario, Canada.

My younger sister has had anorexia for 2 years. She went to the hospital previously in September - November of 2018. Came out, hated my parents for putting her there. Still suffers from the illness, is now medically unstable and has trouble walking up and downstairs and all of her body hurts. No longer in school. I think her organs are starting to shut down. Parents can't convince her to go to the hospital. They're scared to push her to go because a close friend of hers committed suicide recently and they don't want to lose her the same way. 

My understanding is she can't be forced to go to the hospital (i.e. through police or ambulance) without proof of her condition and that she can deny her condition if we call 9-1-1. I go back to university in 3 days. I need to see her in the hospital before that. Any information on how I can get her there before any more damage is done would be great.

###

","Does she have a doctor or psychiatrist? They can complete a Form 1, which will have her picked up by the police and taken to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation. She would have had to have seen the doctor within 7 days of the form being issued. Alternatively, you or your parents can apply for a Form 2 - you would swear information to a Justice of the Peace, and if they agree with you, the Form is issued, your sister is picked up by the police, and taken to hospital for evaluation.

","OP /u/netflixandbarf has the best answer here.   The police won’t force her to go to the hospital themselves because they can only act if there’s an immediate concern for her safety (ie shes likely to commit suicide TONIGHT). 

The bar to have her brought in under a Form 2 is much lower.   Go before a justice, explain all your concerns and have them issue a Form 2 for the police to bring her to the hospital for assessment.

Source: Am intimately familiar with the Alberta Mental Health Act and a review of the Ontario act shows they’re essentially the same structure.

T: GOOD
B: My friend lives in PA and found bed bugs in her apartment. She moved in 2 months ago and on her leasing contract it said that if she found bed bugs in her unit within 48 hours of moving in, they would cover the extermination fees, however she did not find any in that time period and unfortunately will be responsible for the fees which will be around $2,000. They challenged her to contact a lawyer if she wanted them to pay the fee. They did however admit that this incident had occurred before with a other resident. 

I told her that she should print out a general sheet of paper saying that bed bugs had been discovered in some people's residences and to contact the management office for more information, which I helped her write. My coworker and I told her to go down to the management office and tell them she would hand out these memos and slide it under people's doors if the management office would not cover the cost of the exterminator, and to let them know she would wait to hear from them before she began spreading the word. 

She texted me today and showed me an email where they said any attempts to defame their character would force them to contact an attorney. She said they called it 'incite'and that if they heard from any other residents that she had handed out the memo, they would work with an attorney to force her to move out or just sue her in general. They are demanding that she not speak to any residents about this.

","It’s legal for the landlord to have the view that her statements may be defamatory.  And legal for them to sue her for that alleged defamation. 

As to whether or not her statements may actually *be* defamatory, that would depend on the nature of the statements.  Certainly saying that someone in the complex has bedbugs would not appear to be defamatory.  But this kind of action seems to be generally ill-advised.  If she has a dispute over the payment for the infestation she should talk to an attorney about that dispute and litigate it if she has a case. END"

A month later I received calls from Yelp. Saying that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that they were going to help me. I made it clear I didnt have money and did not want to pay anymore for anything else. The guy assured  me he would update my page and call me within 3 days and that nothing would be charged. Two weeks later I still hadn't heard back, and my page didnt have anything new, matter of fact he added a few lines, which I removed. I was so upset. But then I saw my account had been charged, now, over $1,000! Now I was furious. I didnt even know there was a card on file. I called yelp and they are acting stupid. They said that only I can approve and make those changes he made. I never approved anything to be charged and they refuse to issue a refund and that guy will not respond to any point of contact. Is this legal. The guy straight misled me, he lied to me, then he posted lies on my site and yelp is refusing to issue a refund. Also I received 0 business for during this time,~1.5 months.

A month later I received calls from Yelp. Saying that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that they were going to help me. I made it clear I didnt have money and did not want to pay anymore for anything else. The guy assured  me he would update my page and call me within 3 days and that nothing would be charged. Two weeks later I still hadn't heard back, and my page didnt have anything new, matter of fact he added a few lines, which I removed. I was so upset. But then I saw my account had been charged, now, over $1,000! Now I was furious. I didnt even know there was a card on file. I called yelp and they are acting stupid. They said that only I can approve and make those changes he made. I never approved anything to be charged and they refuse to issue a refund and that guy will not respond to any point of contact.

" Q: Landlord is falsely accusing me of smoking weed in apartment.
T: GOOD
B: Hey guys,

I moved into my apartment about 4 months ago, all has been good until about a month ago when I got an email stating that the neighbors were complaining about the smell of weed coming from my apartment, this is a smoke free complex and this is my first warning.

I emailed back saying I do not smoke and I've smelled weed in the hallway once but that was it, my apartment does not smell anything like weed, and I'd be willing to let them come inspect if they'd like.

Last week the entire building got an email saying they still are getting complaints and that they will be performing inspections with no further notice.

Today while I was at work I got an email saying they entered my apartment and the bathroom smells like weed, this is my final warning and if complaints continue I will be evicted with 30 days notice.

I am going to talk to them in person today, what is my best course of action?

I do not smoke weed and never have, I know my apartment doesn't smell like weed and everyone that I've had over confirms this as well.  I think it is either one of the other neighbors and they are trying to pin it on me, as the new tenant, or rent has gone up $100 since I moved in and they're trying to chase me out to get in a tenant paying the new price.

Every other interaction I've had with them has been great, but this is getting annoying and now looks serious.  Any help is much appreciated.

","I know some apt buildings have bathrooms that share vents, to release steam from showers, and other bathroom smells and stuff.   So the fact that they claim a 'weed' smell was found in your bathroom is suspicious.  Having room mates that smoke weed in my apt, (I live in co, and smoking is allowed in my apt) I can tell when they have recently smoked, there is a strong smell.  So that is another reason I find it odd that they found the smell only your bathroom, if you did smoke weed in your apt, it would smell although out, not just one room. 

What may be happening is a unit below or beside you has a tenant that is smoking weed in their bathroom, so as not to get caught by others that live in that same apt.

I would see if the landlords would be willing to show you exactly where they say they encountered the weed smell, and what else they have beside a smell.   I believe you are right that they my be trying to get rid of you and find new tenants. END"
" Q: Found a human tooth in my lasagna.
T: GOOD
B: TLDR: found tooth in lasagna. lasagna company offered $250 dollars to close the case. they didnt really take responsibility for it, but want to end their investigation (in my opinion prematurely)

&amp;#x200B;

I won't be able to name specific companies involved or anything because of an outstanding claim that exists with this specific lasagna company's insurance, but hopefully I can get some advice. We live in Salt Lake City Utah

A few months ago I was eating some frozen lasagna and chomped down on something hard. Looking back it's actually kind of funny, because I was eating while playing a game and was momentarily too distracted to realize what I had bitten down on. I soon figured out it was a tooth. Pretty fucking grossed out, but nothing bad really happened. I assumed this would just end up being a funny and slightly disturbing story to tell.

My fiance's mother was really concerned when we told her. She convinced us that it was a matter of public safety, and we should report it somehow. So we filed a claim with the grocer's health department and waited to hear back. They gave us a bit of a run around, transfering us from one 'adjuster' to the next. Eventually they requested we send the tooth to them in the mail for analysis. (I had saved it like a serial killer in the fridge -- [warning: tooth](https://imgur.com/a/tSh1DoC)).

So, some time goes by and their representative emails us back confirming that not only was it a **human tooth**, but somehow a **child's tooth**? Fucking nasty. My favorite food is ruined forever. Around this time, they had transferred us to people on behalf of the lasagna company and washed their hands of the situation I suppose. The lasagna folks announce to us that they have filed an official insurance claim and that we were to wait for the next steps.

I guess at this point we were only hoping for some sort of resolution. How did a kid's tooth get in the lasagna? Was there... *gulp* ... the remains of the rest of the child spread throughout thousands of lasagnas worldwide? Was it some sort of kid sweatshop? My friend's joked that I should sue them or something, but for what? For being grossed out? I had no medical bills or anything. I just wanted to see the results of their investigation, and at the very least get my lasagna purchase reimbursed.

The last thing we have heard is that they don't know where the tooth came from and that their investigation is essentially over. Their insurance agent offered us $250 dollars and wanted to close the case.

Personally I was stunned that they offered us money. My fiancee and her mother urged me to not take it. They are worried that the company is just trying to pay us off and sweep the situation under the rug. As far as I know, there will be no recall of products and no further investigation.

I guess my main question is: do we have a moral obligation to keep pushing the claim until this company takes some sort of actionable responsibility for the incident? It feels like there could be something scummy going on here. I know the WHO takes these things pretty seriously, but nothing like this has ever happened so I'm not really sure what my rights or obligations are.

thanks for reading, cheers

&gt;Please contact the [city] Rental Inspections Division immediately at [number] to resolve this issue.

Emphasis theirs. As my title says, our assumption is that the landlord did not renew his rental license when it last expired. My SO is the one officially renting from him for the past 6 years, me being here for the past 4-ish. Last fall the landlord had mentioned wanting to sell the house and asked if he could put a for sale sign out, but he never did. 

My question is whether we should contact the landlord first and see what he has to say or should we call the rental division first? Also just wondering what our rights/responsibilities are here. We are current on rent payments and are on a month-to-month basis. We were also planning on hopefully buying a house in the next 3-4 months if possible (pending pandemic issues, of course) so this might be the nudge we need to get going. Obviously we won't ignore the issue, but we want to have as much info going into either conversation (with the landlord or the rental inspections division) as we can.

B: PA, United States.

Our lease states the landlord will provide a working refrigerator, microwave, stove/oven, and washer dryer. We brought our own washer/dry when we moved in and we allowed him to take his old 1980's ish washer to use at another tenant's place - no problem. The apartment isn't a dump, but the fridge is older.

Our freezer has days it completely stops working and will get to 50 degrees by morning. We unplug and replug a few times, as well as hit it, and it will come back on. It's 30 years old and the LL agreed we needed a ""new"" one.

Shows up a few days ago with one from \~1970 (50 years old) from someone who bought a condo was getting rid of (probably for free). Bought it over and after plugging it in, there's a heavy cigarette smoke smell from inside, enough we don't want to put food in and start coughing when it's open. It'll stink up the entire kitchen. It's trash really and 20 years older than the one we had (which he left here too).

He's telling us just to clean it out with baking soda, but we feel it's stuck in the coils/evaporator as nothing we've done makes it better.

Do we have any legal recourse to get a non-smoke filled, sanitary fridge?

","Of course the LL can't smell anything. Bit weird though that he told you to clean it a certain way so the smell will go away... That in combination with him not really knowing it's origin sounds fishy to me, tbh. END"

" Q: Employer says I will lose the remainder of PTO I would have accrued for the remainder of the year [California]
T: GOOD
B: Hello everyone,

I accrue a certain amount of hours per pay period with a PTO cap of X amount of hours. I reached my cap sometime last month. I had planned to go on vacation this month, but with the whole pandemic going on, that didn't happen.

Last month, the company decided to front-load the remainder of the year's PTO hours company-wide so that people had them in the event they or a family member became sick. Some colleague's PTO balance went from 40 hours to 211, 30 hours to 165, etc. 

Since my PTO was at it's cap at the time they distributed the front-load, I was given 0 hours. I was told by HR that I would not be accruing anymore hours for the remainder of the year, and I would not be paid for the cap overage. They mentioned that if this happened again in the 2021 calendar year, the overage would be paid out, but not this year.

I have been with the company for a few years and front-loading is not in the policy, nor has it happened before. I assume they did this in response to the pandemic. Obviously, if I knew they were going to do this, I would have used up the hours I needed to.

I calculated that I just lost out on about 100 hours of PTO. When I asked if this is the case, HR confirmed that I was not given my hours because I had hit the limit and I did indeed lose out on PTO for the remainder of the year.

 I know CA is particular about PTO hours and I know this situation doesn't fall under ""use-it-or-lose-it"", which is prohibited in CA, because that only applies to hours that I've already earned.

Do I have any recourse here?

","IANAL, but work in public accounting in CA. It is pretty standard for companies to have a cap on you accruing of PTO as CA doesn’t allow PTO to be lost. So instead of you losing your PTO after a certain time, companies in CA instead just stop giving you additional hours. This is usually in the Employee Handbook. 

You are not entitled to PTO by law, so I don’t see the case here unfortunately. END"

T: GOOD
B: I am in Texas.

Yesterday I had a very minor accident (superficial scratches on all 3 cars):
So there was construction which caused a lane closure. Someone way ahead cut in front and caused a chain reaction. The lady in front of me (A) slammed her brakes, so I slammed mine. I then got rear-ended by (B) which pushed me into A

B was super nice and compliant and even said she was sorry to both me and A. She goes to give me her insurance and ID, I take a picture and then take a pic of license plate and then wait for the police, since A called them right away.  

We wait for police and he gets our info and asks what happened. We eventually go on our merry ways and when I get home, I call their insurance, at which point I realized it was 3 years expired. I fucked up for sure by not checking it, but then I check the picture of the police report later, and I found out that she gave them the proper insurance! 

Today i get a call from my insurance saying A has filed a claim against me, despite her knowing that I only collided with her because of B. I'm not sure what's going on, but I told them my side and they said that changes things. I call B's insurance and they went through a process to finally get to an agent, but in that process I found that they already had my information and I have never dealt with them before so now I'm thinking B might've filed a claim against me. I called the agent and he didn't pick up, so now I have to wait until Monday to call. 

What can I do if everything goes south and B just continues to lie about things and A continues after me? I don't know what the police report says because I didn't see it, I just got A and B's info from them. But I explained things extremely straightforward and no bias to the officer.

Maybe it was an honest mistake, maybe she thought she could pull a fast one but thought better of it with the cops.

" Q: Girl has been cyberbullying/harassing me for over a month. IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)
T: GOOD
B: Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!

It's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.

Naturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me ""sweet, beautiful, and love"". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.

Now let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her ""Thank you!"" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. 

One random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\*t about them, and that I was ""drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled"". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! 

I was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....

...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. 

Everything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest. At that point, she had been posting on it for a week before I found out about it.

 It was a fake account, but I instantly knew it was her (typing and word style, emoji usage, similarities between her real account and the fake account, and she admitted in one of the posts that she did the same thing over a year ago). 

It became clear to me that this girl is not stable and I wanted to protect my safety, so I filed a police report for harassment. The police are currently investigating, although the investigator said, ""we probably can't do much because it's on social media and hard to prove it's her"", but I have so many screenshots that link her to the profile, but I'm afraid I won't get very far with the local police with this.

She does not live in my same city anymore, but she's just a few hours away. This account is seriously causing me some major emotional distress. I have reported it over and over to IG and have had trusted friends report it as well, but because of COVID-19, IG is saying they don't have enough people on staff to review the profile. 

But then, I woke up this morning to the girl now posting my work information on the fake profile. My work email, my work phone number, and saying ""for a good time to call me"" and I can't get IG to do anything about this. I have a really good job and I do not want her compromising it. She is still currently posting as I type. She has over 100 posts about me now, most including my personal information and slanderous comments. 

What can I do? Is there any way to get ahold of IG, and could they be liable for emotional distress?  I'm sure I have a case against her as well, but I do know she doesn't have very much money - might not be worth it or could it?

###

","&gt; I haven’t approached my attorney with the lawsuit idea yet as I’d like to wait for the ruling. Also, they specialize in family law and am not sure if this in their realm of expertise.

There are two categories of questions here. 

The first is do you have a case, do you have losses to win in that case, and do you have any chance at recovery of those losses.  It would be hard to answer that from here.  

As u/Selphis points out, that depends some on what interfering with your job means.  But it also looks at the fundamental defamation question - did she say things that she knew to be untrue, or did she say opinions and things she believed to be true when she said them.  

In general, in these kinds of statements, there would be much room for opinion or conclusions she reached even those they happened to be wrong.  A case might depend on *establishing with evidence* that she maliciously lied and not just that she was mistaken.  

The other question, and perhaps the even more likely reason that it would be unwise to sue here, is the impact that doing so might have on your custody case and on your ongoing coparenting arrangement (remember that very nearly *all* parents end up coparenting to some extent).  It's *likely* there isn't as much to gain here as there may be to lose, and your current attorney is the one to begin answering that question. END"

That are a lot of contributing factors that I left out, one of which is a detailed police report that’s 30 pages long and describes all of the insane things they did over a period of months. Right as the case was nearing a decision, a second false accusation of molestation was made and I was cleared again. Suffice it to say we are both confident in the upcoming ruling. I haven’t approached my attorney with the lawsuit idea yet as I’d like to wait for the ruling. Also, they specialize in family law and am not sure if this in their realm of expertise. That’s why I posted on here. To get some feelers before asking them about it. END"
" Q: Ex has falsely accused me of molesting my child on several occasions.
T: BAD
B: At least 2 of them have turned into DCFS and local PD investigations, which I have been obviously cleared of in both cases. We are expecting a final judgment on the custody matter any day now, and while I have no doubt I will end up with majority, if not sole custody, I was wondering if I have grounds to sue her after. Many people know about the accusations and also she has attempted to interfere with my job. Can I, and should I sue her, and what can I sue her for?

You should discuss that with your lawyer.

" Q: My parents threw out all of my belongings while I was travelling - BC, Canada
T: BAD
B: So, I just got home to Canada after being away for 7 months in Australia to find out my mother and stepdad donated all of my clothes and pretty much everything I own to the salvation army/threw in garbage. I really need advice so if someone could please read my story I would really appreciate it.

I live in British Columbia, Canada.


I needed to put my items in storage when I was planning on travelling Australia, so I asked my mom and stepdad to help me move out of my apartment and store my items and they offered to help me if I paid them something like $100 for the gas, I agreed (stepdad has a work truck). 
I had packed about half of everything and they came over and helped me pack the rest(along with my friends), I put all of my clothes into garbage bags (about 8-10 bags), we moved all my necessities (including mattress, duvet, duvet cover, desk, bed frame, everything I owned) into the work truck and I told them to just put all my stuff under their house in the basement. 

I was originally going to donate some bags of clothes but I didn't have enough time to sort through them so we donated some furniture (my couches) to the salvation army, they wouldn't accept one of them so my stepdad said he would go to the dump and throw it out. I told them I'd deal with everything else when I get back in a year or so (they have a lot of storage space).


**Fast forward**: I had to come home early due to covid, so after about 30 hours of travel I arrive back in Canada to my parents house. I went under the house because I wanted to wear a big comfy sweater that I missed (I only brought a suitcase of summer clothes to Australia because I knew it would be much warmer there). I go under the house and can't find any bags of clothing... I ask my mom where she put them and she said ""I'm not sure, whatever isn't there was donated"". WHAT?? They never said they were going to donate anything, as I asked them to keep all the boxes and bags. I asked further and she said that my roommate told them they could be donated, I immediately messaged him and he said that he heard them joking about just donating the items when I left, and he said he chimed in and said that he himself got rid of all of his stuff and joked around with them. I told her that excuse was bullshit and they could have had any ANY type of communication with me and I would told them to NOT get rid of the items... 

My mom then said that some of the boxes were ripped and the bags had holes in them so she got rid of them. I continued to search and couldn't find much of anything. They got rid of my duvet, mattress, both of my memory foams pillows, drawing books with all my drawing supplies, VR headset, Samsung galaxy s8+ (including photos and memories that I did NOT upload), 500$ headphones, Google nexus, iPod, Nintendo 3ds, stereo system, they were ALL GONE along with all my clothes. 

They would not have sold my items (they aren't intelligent enough to figure out prices and sell them). So they just threw out or donated them because they didn't want to deal with them. What they DID keep was reorganized into boxes and they labelled themselves. They kept DVDs, CDs, my Xbox 360, my computer and monitor and a bag with some jackets and shoes and then pots and pans. 

I am beyond heartbroken. I had so many sentimental items from travelling and clothing items and if I knew they were going to do this I would have called literally ANYONE else to store my things. 

I am talking to them tomorrow since my stepdad comes home (he works in a different city) and I literally don't know what to do. I am in 14 day isolation so I haven't been talking with my mother. I know my stepdad will try and shove it back in my face by saying ""oh you left us with too much shit!"" But they didn't say ONE word to me that they didn't want to deal with it.

 I am a grown 25 year old man and they treat me and my belongings like I'm a child. Do I tell them to repay me for all of the items or talk to a lawyer about this? I am so nervous about the talk tomorrow - My step dad is quite manipulative and gets rid of things that clog up space for him, and my mom is a push over and gets stressed at the smallest things and is very emotionally immature so tomorrow is going to be very difficult. 

I don't have any intention of talking to my parents ever again after this. I trusted them and they completely betrayed that trust. All it would have taken is a phone call and I could have gotten someone to pick up my stuff or hired a moving company to put it in a storage locker. I feel empty and like I have nothing now. I was super into fashion and had so many expensive designer items, professional workwear and winter clothes that were donated and things collected over the years from travelling/concerts/festivals. 


Can anyone **please** give me advice on how to deal with this? I'm overwhelmed at the moment and am quite exhausted from crying so much.

That is all old stuff, may be brand new would have costed what, 1000/2000 USD, used im sure that it would cost a lot of work to publish and may be if you are lucky would get close to 500/750 usd. To file a claim (in the US) would cost around 250 + whatever your lawyer charges... you would end up loosing money.

It really sounds like you had a bunch of old crap that due to poor planing on your part did not have enough time to pack and you left your parents in charge of taking care of your crap. If you were not organized enough to plan ahead for your trip (which it was meant to be for years so I doubt you decided that suddenly) then you should not complain about how things were handled when you, yourself where not willing to handle them.

You are quoting things like ""an ipod"" (you can get one for 25 on ebay). Google nexus for 50.... I mean its all old crap that if you were to travel for as long as you planned they would even be worth less than that..... I think you are blowing everything way out of proportion and you should just write it off and move on with your life. May be thanked them for helping you get rid of all that clutter.

EDIT:

A grown 25 year old man, should not be cyring about stupid meaning less sutff that in monetary value weren't even worth more than 500 usd. You are angry about ""memory foam pillows"" that cost 15 bucks BRAND NEW on ebay.... come on, grow up dude. There is more serious shit going on in the world right now than to be crying for old crap that you were never going to use anyway. END"

","You may get some good legal advice here, about how to sue your parents for damages for their carelessness and inconsiderate behaviors, when they verbally agreed to do something for you and care for your property.

You may want to pursue the legal option, but threatening your family with a lawsuit is a pretty ""nuclear"" option. May I also suggest you reach out to some other relationship subreddit (/r/relationships is the first that comes to mind, but there might be some other more appropriate ones too). Because there may be some other ways to get you what you want before reaching that point. END"

","I don't have enough information to give legal advice but honestly it sounds like you need more life advice on another sub.

Why are you leaving your life's belongings in your parents care when there are some obvious issues.

Why are you traveling around Australia when you don't have a home of your own to store your things.

Are you employed? If not why not. What are your income sources?

Are you upgrading your marketable skills? Working on your health, finances, relationships, etc? 

Use this as a catalyst to get your own house in order. There is a whole world waiting for you out there.

" Q: Trade Show Cancelled due to Coronavirus but still being Charged :(
T: BAD
B: I had a trade show booked for June and have just been told it's been 'postponed' but the postponed date is actually the same date as it would have been held in 2021 as it's a yearly show. They haven't said this year has been 'cancelled' probably because the contract would then be void. This means they will have the money I've paid already for an extra year and are holding me to keep the stand I've booked. Obviously it's a testing time for most businesses and I don't even know if my business will survive so I could do with the money and not having to worry that I need to pay the remainder. Can anyone offer any advice? Thanks

","You're a good landlord for posting this to start, and moreso for taking the safety of your tenants into account by buying them cleaning supplies. 

Tenants don't have to inform you if they get sick; at the same time, you also don't have to inform other tenants if one gets sick as well. However, in such a small space, if someone does become symptomatic I doubt it will be difficult to conceal. 

Prepare a message to send to your tenants in the event that someone does get sick, if you feel that you want to. Highlight the extra steps you're taking, and steps that can be followed inside the apartments to keep them cleaner as well.

Hiring a cleaning staff to disinfect should someone contract the disease afterwards can help. Besides that, you're still providing a habitable place for your tenants. END"

She’s claiming that since she paid for them &amp; I live under her roof that she’s allowed to control &amp; monitor my prescriptions, is this true? I am an adult. 

Side note- I’m not an idiot &amp; I’m not entirely sure what she’s doing with these pills.

The fact that she didn’t tell me &amp; was being secretive/defensive when I called her out on it leaves me to believe that her “monitoring” my pills might not have been her intent. &amp; she’s being forced to work from home now, my mom &amp; I both have attention issues, I know it’s hard for her to focus while working at home but that doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all trial on prescriptions.

But yeah, basically I need to know if she’s legally allowed to take my meds from me or not? Again, Idaho law. Thanks.

","I, too, want a pony.

Your landlord can ask for anything they want. Your obligations are as set out in the lease - and I can't imagine your lease language includes anything either requiring you to maintain employment, or requiring you to pay rent in advance in the event of unemployment.

He has no legal way to force you to leave on the spot. California courts are not processing evictions outside of some narrow circumstances, so he has no way to have his ridiculous demand given a hearing, either. If your landlord pulls a gun on you, get to safety and call the police. END"

","Good - you're a tenant and not a [lodger](http://www.lapublichealth.org/eh/docs/housing/brochure/tenright.pdf) (see page 14 of this PDF). That means he'll need to go through a formal eviction if he wants to evict you. He can't just give you a notice and tell you to leave. 

[Orange County wrote up this really nice piece on how to evict lodgers](https://www.ocsd.org/divisions/prof/court/civil/lodgers) *but it doesn't apply to you*. He'll need to serve you with the standard advanced notice for your lease to be terminated. This means you'll get a 30 day notice to terminate the lease if you've lived there for under a year and a 60 day notice if you've lived there for more than a year. After that, you'd need to be evicted if you stayed. 

He can't demand your refund/stimulus check and a court would not award him damages/extras because you refused to give it to him. As a purely practical matter, I'm not even sure how he could find out if you got one. Paper checks will be mailed as late as September. END"

","Can you tell if she's actually home? (Is her car there, are the lights on, ect?)

I'm going to advise against breaking into the house at all possible- if only because breaking into a building with someone who's made it clear you're not wanted is likely to escalate to violence.

Call the police again. Tell them that you've been locked out of the house after an argument with your mother and that she's not answering her phone or the door and that its been \[x length of time\]. Tell them that you're afraid and that you need help. 

When an officer arrives ask them to help you find someplace safe to spend the night because you think you've been kicked out- even if it's just the police station. Tell them what you told us.

If they still don't help contact friends and family and see if they'll come to get you and let you spend a night. END"

","It's not money laundering - it's worse.

It's a romance scam that led to a fake check scam.

Every penny that was sent to the scammer is already lost, and all the deposits will bounce after the bank figures out they were fraudulent.

Even if she is just used as a money/parcel mule, she could be sued by the people whose checks she is cashing to send money to the scammer.

In the past, people lost their entire savings in such scams, and they are amazingly hard to convince they are being scammed - after all, that person ""loves them"".

https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/doh6kd/rscams_common_scam_master_post/


&gt;The fake check scam arises from many different situations (for instance, you applied for a job, or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist, or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business, or you were offered a job as a mystery shopper, you were asked to wrap your car with an advertisement, or you received a check in the mail for no reason), but the bottom line is always something like this:

&gt;The scammer sends you a very real looking, but fake, check. Sometimes they'll call it a ""cashier's check"", a ""certified check"", or a ""verified check"".

&gt;You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account is not the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law.

&gt;For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins.

&gt;Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems. END"

","So my (and my wife's) understanding is that after a previous fake cheque, the banks no longer trust her to hold accounts so instead she's simply been added to one of her daughter's accounts who hasn't seen any cheque issues showing up, and that she's been using some sort of service to send the cheques she now receives straight into a bitcoin account.

","This is worse than just check fraud my guy,  obligatory not a lawyer but from having worked in the check cashing industry for 2 years i can tell you this.

If those checks are being stolen, your MIL more than likely Will face lawsuit and/or arrest. I have personally seen the arrest of more stolen check presenters than i care for. If the checks are being sent through an account attached to her daughter then her daughter faces legal consequences as well. For the good of your family you HAVE to convince her to STOP communicating with the person at all costs. Unfortunately thats probably gonna mean getting the police involved.

The package NEEDS to be turned in to the police or at bare minimum returned to sender. Thats will EASILY get your family in a LOT more trouble. 

Finally it is exceedingly dangerous that she gave YOUR address to the scammer as that means if they are the malicious type they know where you live. Record the From address on the box as the police are going to need that.


Again i am NOT a lawyer i CANNOT tell you what to do or give you OFFICIAL legal advice. BUT if it was my family.... id be calling the police, tell them everything, turn over the package DO NOT let your MIL get it, and have her daughter close down both hers and your MILs accounts. This could be an extremely dangerous situation depending on how malicious the scammers are. And whatever you do DO NOT OPEN THE PACKAGE. END"

I paid rent on time, and I only stayed there for 4 days. It is COVID-19. I am living out of boxes and staying in a motel as I still have to work. Can someone please tell me what I can do legally to report her. I have no family in WA and she has left me stranded.

" Q: Leafblowers at apartment complex M-F almost non-stop from as early as 7am-4pm
T: GOOD
B: State: Nevada

My apartment complex seems to have people on their staff whose sole job it is to walk around the property with leaf blowers during the work week. I hardly ever see them actually picking up the leaves that they're blowing around (seriously, I've seen them do this maybe twice in the entire two years I've lived here) and so the leaves just blow back the next day but never fear because they're out there again to battle the leaves the following day!

I work freelance so I work irregular hours, hence why I'm frequently at home listening to this. I get that they're doing this during the ""normal"" workday while most people are out, but five days a week seems a bit excessive. Every other complex I've lived at, in this state and elsewhere, always limited their landscaping to one day a week. 

I can't seem to find anything in the noise ordinance for my city, and since it's happening during normal workday hours, I've been hesitant to bring it up with my office management because they can technically do what they want with their property during these hours. 

Is there anything legally I can do? At least my lease is up in a few months and I'll be moving out. I'm currently pregnant and the thought of living here with a newborn sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.

" Q: [OHIO] Landlord Physically Cut Internet Cables
T: GOOD
B: I can't believe this is real but...

I'm living at an apartment complex in Ohio. Current landlord has purchased the apartment building from the previous landlord and has been owning and making demands of the tenants for a few months now.

One of the demands was that we contact the internet service provider to have them relocate the cables they've ran into the apartment because they are an eyesore. I told him I was not given an option for where or how the cabling entered the building (the cabling was there when I moved in) and he should contact the ISP to discuss moving the cables, as multiple tenants connections run into the building at the same spot. I thought this would be the better option as he could oversee the new cable installation to bring up any concerns and would keep the ISP from having to make multiple trips to relocate cabling.

Well, today, he stopped by the apartments and physically cut the ISP cables on the outside of the building where they entered. Thus killing internet access to the building. This has also affected my work as I am supposed to be working remote, but that is impossible with no internet. I've contacted them and they will be out this afternoon to reconnect it.

I'm looking for advice on what I need to do to make sure I don't have to pay the ISP for the reconnection or to be reimbursed if I am charged. Also, is it legal for the landlord to cut the internet connection to my apartment?

UPDATE: The ISP came out and said they could relocate and reinstall the cables but they require the building owners permission to do so. We contacted the landlord to ask him to contact Spectrum in order to give them permission and he refused. He said he will not be contacting any ISPs. 

At this point, it seems like he's just trying to push all of the current tenants out of the building so he can raise the rent as he's done on the vacant apartments.

###

","I work with cable companies like Spectrum, Comcast, ATT etc. It likely is the ISP’s property. Most ISP’s claim responsibility for all cables running into homes, businesses and buildings. They pay for install, maintenance, replacement and utility locates when work is needing to be done in the area.  
I’ve seen this before where someone cuts a cable to get the attention of the provider due to response time. He will likely flip the bill for those cables. If it’s coax my guess is $300-500 per cable as that’s what they charge us if we damage one. 
Not a lawyer obviously but I assume if you can prove loss of income due to no internet you could take him to small claims too. END"

" Q: Law Firm wants me to maintain their web app for next to nothing
T: GOOD
B: Hi all,

I started working on a webapp 4+ years ago for a family members law firm. Basically the app takes PSI and puts it in standard government forms. The issue with the forms is that they get updated a lot. At the time I worked out with the family member that I would get paid $50 dollars per case. This never panned out so I worked out that I would get paid hourly ($150/h). I know that rate sounds steep but they can afford it due the high volume of cases that my app enables them to process. In addition, other firms have full time employees that literally just do form programming.

The issue arrived recently where they stopped paying my invoices to update the forms. Their argument is that it was a ""subscription service"". Yes, I attempted to make it a subscription service, and even got two customers, but the monthly income is not enough to cover my hourly labor. I couldn't even hire a 10/h Indian laborer to make it worth it.

So yesterday, after releasing the government agency pushed out updates to 7+ of their forms, I realized that I cannot do it anymore because my carpal tunnel syndrome was really kicking off (I have a full time job in addition to this job). I sent an email out stating that I am going to shut down in 60 days and provided an alternative service to they can migrate to. Now they are threatening to sue for all the customization (form programming and this government API interface) I did for them.

What type of lawyer will I need to fight this? I never had a contract or anything. I made like \~30k in the past 4 years.

Their claim (if any) would have to be based in contract.  You'd want a lawyer with a practice in business contracts - ideally software contracts.  

It doesn't sound from your description like they have a case.  Threats to sue are often idle.  If they actually sue you definitely need a lawyer.  Until they file and serve you I'd treat it as noise.  

There's a ton of noise in your story about what they can afford, how much you've earned, and what fulfilling the agreement would cost that isn't relevant to the issue at hand either, so it is hard to be sure from your story what the agreement really was. END"

" Q: Received a Subpoena to appear in a state I have never been to in my life
T: GOOD
B: I received a letter by mail asking for a ""waiver of personal service"" to be signed and returned or else I would be served in person following 10 days of no response.

This is regarding a criminal trial in which I assume I am listed as a witness / victim in.

The problem is... All of this occurred in the state I live in - the original incident, my statement to the police, etc. And meanwhile for whatever reason the subpoena is asking me to appear ~2,000 miles away across the country where apparently the accused is held and trial will take place. Nonetheless this is occurring during a pandemic in which I would be required to fly in a plane, stay in a hotel, simply breaking the social isolation policies I have been following.

I called up the phone number listed on the paper right away to try and clarify, but I wasn't given any information other than that if they don't get my signature within 10 days, ""they will have a sheriff hand delivering it to my front door"" said in a really dismissive and rude tone. I was also informed that if I just sign it they will cover travel expenses.

To further detail the case, it is fairly high profile and I am **assuming** is being held out of state because the accused also committed offenses there. I am in contact with 2 other victims who also received the same paperwork however each of them was much more involved and has way more substantial testimony against him and has been in contact over the past year with lawyers and what not.

Basically, I don't know what to do here:

I have already contacted them so they know that I received the letter.

If I don't do anything and wait to be served in person, is there any legal consequence to this? I still don't fully understand what I am signing over to them even though I tried to Google the topic. Furthermore, if I don't comply with them now I'm worried I won't be given the same financial assurance that everything would be payed for and I am already struggling financially.

So Reddit:
A.) Should I sign the thing and return it
B.) Do nothing and wait for a sheriff to roll up to my house
C.) Hire a lawyer to deal with this (big expense that I really can't bare right now)

My ideal outcome would be just not having to deal with any of this.

Failing that, I wouldn't mind giving a deposition over the phone / Skype 

Worst case scenario is being served in person right before trial and having to book travel plans last minute / take on a financial burden / health risk

I feel bad because what this guy did was horrible and I don't want to get in the way of the case being prosecuted, but at the same time, we are currently facing a pandemic and flying just doesn't seem safe. I also feel like I don't have anything to really add to their case as what I experienced and saw was such a small part of everything that happened. I do understand they just want the best chances for the case.

Thank you for any responses I'm really unsure of what to do

&gt;A.) Should I sign the thing and return it

Might as well

&gt;C.) Hire a lawyer to deal with this (big expense that I really can't bare right now)

Pointless at this time.

&gt;My ideal outcome would be just not having to deal with any of this.

Not up to you unfortunately.

This isn't something that will happen fast and the DA will want to talk to you well before the trial to see if he even wants you there. Respond to the subpoena and wait. Eventually they will reach out to you and you can explain your situation. END"
" Q: Received a Subpoena to appear in a state I have never been to in my life
T: GOOD
B: I received a letter by mail asking for a ""waiver of personal service"" to be signed and returned or else I would be served in person following 10 days of no response.

This is regarding a criminal trial in which I assume I am listed as a witness / victim in.

The problem is... All of this occurred in the state I live in - the original incident, my statement to the police, etc. And meanwhile for whatever reason the subpoena is asking me to appear ~2,000 miles away across the country where apparently the accused is held and trial will take place. Nonetheless this is occurring during a pandemic in which I would be required to fly in a plane, stay in a hotel, simply breaking the social isolation policies I have been following.

I called up the phone number listed on the paper right away to try and clarify, but I wasn't given any information other than that if they don't get my signature within 10 days, ""they will have a sheriff hand delivering it to my front door"" said in a really dismissive and rude tone. I was also informed that if I just sign it they will cover travel expenses.

To further detail the case, it is fairly high profile and I am **assuming** is being held out of state because the accused also committed offenses there. I am in contact with 2 other victims who also received the same paperwork however each of them was much more involved and has way more substantial testimony against him and has been in contact over the past year with lawyers and what not.

Basically, I don't know what to do here:

I have already contacted them so they know that I received the letter.

If I don't do anything and wait to be served in person, is there any legal consequence to this? I still don't fully understand what I am signing over to them even though I tried to Google the topic. Furthermore, if I don't comply with them now I'm worried I won't be given the same financial assurance that everything would be payed for and I am already struggling financially.

So Reddit:
A.) Should I sign the thing and return it
B.) Do nothing and wait for a sheriff to roll up to my house
C.) Hire a lawyer to deal with this (big expense that I really can't bare right now)

My ideal outcome would be just not having to deal with any of this.

Failing that, I wouldn't mind giving a deposition over the phone / Skype 

Worst case scenario is being served in person right before trial and having to book travel plans last minute / take on a financial burden / health risk

I feel bad because what this guy did was horrible and I don't want to get in the way of the case being prosecuted, but at the same time, we are currently facing a pandemic and flying just doesn't seem safe. I also feel like I don't have anything to really add to their case as what I experienced and saw was such a small part of everything that happened. I do understand they just want the best chances for the case.

Thank you for any responses I'm really unsure of what to do

I understand that if I was the star witness or something that they would really put in effort to serving me in person but given that I know very little I think now that if I just ignore it until then there is probably a high chance of them just forgetting about me instead of dealing with all of these out of state jurisdictions.

" Q: Father bought stocks for himself using my name; any way to change the name attached to the stocks? Negatively affecting my tax returns
T: GOOD
B: My father helped me file my tax returns this year.  It’s the first year I insisted that he show me how to do it (I’m 24, I know I have no excuse for waiting so long to learn to do my own taxes), since every year before this, he would just do it without telling me, and I’ve never seen my return checks before.  But since this was the first year my parents couldn’t claim me as a dependent, I insisted on learning.

He got pretty shifty halfway through, and he finally admitted to me that he bought stocks for himself using my name when I was a minor so that he wouldn‘t have to pay taxes on them, and made himself the sole trustee.  He has no intention of ever giving the money to me.  This knocked a good amount of money off of my tax return, so he paid me the difference out of his pocket.  I’m furious, but not as surprised as I should be, considering he’s been financially abusive in the past.

I told him I’m not comfortable having any account I have no control over in my name, or our “arrangement“ where he pays me the difference on my tax return, and asked if there was any way to change the name attatched to the stocks.  He claims there is not, and that in order to remove my name, he would have to sell the stocks, which he refuses to do.  He claims that what he did was perfectly legal.

Was it really legal?  Could I get in some kind of trouble for this?  Is there any way for me to remove my name from the stocks, or the stocks from my name?  I’m afraid that he could use this against me in the future, but I also don’t want to get him in legal trouble.

Normally I would totally understand but we are in the middle of a pandemic and it's impossible to find a home because they are all (rightfully so) on lockdown to avoid the spread of the disease. He is a veteran and someone who needs care from nurses 24/7, he can't feed himself he is on a feeding tube. The option of him coming with my family is being presented but he is considered very high risk and I was sick just last week. They also presented the option of charging us $300 per day (this is the price without insurance) which is simply not feasible.

Is it legal for them to ""kick him out"" during all of this? I'm thinking it probably is because it's not their fault we can't afford it, but would like to know what someone else would say.

","None of this is your fault. One of the hardest parts of finding justice after someone raped you is talking about it. Once it's out there, you feel you have no control, you're afraid of judgement, and you have no idea what to do next, but you're not alone.

You can contact [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/recovering-sexual-violence) at 800-656-4673, they have resources to get you through this.

I won't mince words. It's terrifying, telling your parents. Obviously I don't know your situation, but especially because you were underaged, I'm going to bet they'll want this predator behind bars.

Please stay strong, and file a police report. When rapists use threatening tactics like this, it means they're scared. It means you have the power. You do. I hope you report him. I'm sorry to say that the threats usually continue if they're not reported. If you give into his demands, he'll believe he still has power over you. The difference between reporting and not reporting is that the police can only do something if you tell them what's happening. END"

###

","&gt;would his parents be responsible for the restitution?

No one here can answer that question. That will be a matter for the judge in that specific case to decide.

&gt;Or is he just going to get a slap on the wrist for being a minor?

I would think it's very, very unlikely that a 17-and-almost-18 year old would get a ""slap on the wrist"" for stabbing a person and causing serious injury, but greater injustices have happened.

In general, the wealthier the defendant, the higher the likelihood that they receive minimal punishment. That will depend on how good of a lawyer he gets, how charismatic the judge finds him, and how convincing he can be that he either didn't understand the consequences of his actions or he is truly remorseful.

Minimal punishment, such as probation with no jail time or community service only will *NOT* prevent you from seeking restitution through the criminal case.

If the criminal case is dismissed by the district attorney or reduced to a charge that somehow doesn't allow you to file for restitution as a victim, you would be entitled to sue him for your damages in a civil case.

&gt;I don’t want to go through the process for no reason, basically.

It's not clear what process you mean, but I can't imagine what you're referring to here. If your family member really did stab you and injure you, it's *very* unlikely that they will be able to completely escape liability.

Even if he doesn't have the money to pay for your damages now, the court order that commands him to pay restitution will be enforceable for decades. He would be required to make payments on it as is feasible based on his income and/or assets. END"

","I am not a lawyer

Looks to me like the parents are on the hook for up to $7500.  You can file for that in small claims court, which should be easy enough to do (Google it for Oregon).  However, a
State victim fund might supercede this.

Also, if you have medical insurance, it's possible that your insurance company can demand some or all of that award to cover their costs. That is well beyond my understanding though.

If I were you, I'd sue in small claims for any expenses or loss of work you have, along with any loss of use of your hand you might have (that gets complicated, but I imagine small claims will set you straight if that's not cool).

When and if you are paid, put it in the bank and only pay your medical bills with it until this thing is resolved. Once you know your insurance won't go after the remaining amount, spend it as you wish.

" Q: (MI) High Risk Employee Recalled while on unemployment after company got PPP loan - hourly salary cut over 55% for next 2 months - accept or be terminated
T: GOOD
B: Throwaway posting for my dad.

He is high risk for COVID, left work and went on unemployment 2.5 weeks ago due to COVID19 due to doctors letter saying he was high risk and the business closed not long after.

However he was recalled today because the company got a PPP loan and was told he would be paid \~45% his normal flat rate hourly work then he was hired at for the next 2 months starting on this past Monday. If he didn't like that pay plan he would be terminated. The company did say if he made over that flat rate at the end of 2 months they would settle up with him then.

Now he is making considerably more on unemployment and does not want to return to work due to the medically high risk and certainly not for just over 10/hr when he was making almost 3x that before unemployment and they are still taking taxes and significant healthcare plan cost (over 200/pp). Is it legal what they are doing? He does not want to loose his job but certainly doesn't want to be paid 10/hr to be working in a risky environment.

###

","He has already been terminated (which is why he is receiving unemployment). His employer has NOT offered him his job back -- they offered him some other job that pays a LOT less.

He should probably decline the offer of this lesser job even if his employer will never rehire him because of doing so -- no job is worth his life. He should not lose unemployment for turning down a comparable job offer because this wasn't a comparable job. But be sure to get the proposed salary in writing because an employer that slimy may lie about what they offered him.

The employer is quite possibly lying to the PPP program... I believe the loans are only forgiven if employees are rehired at similar wages (90%+) to what they were previously making. END"

" Q: Car towed out of my own driveway
T: GOOD
B: I live in San Jose, California. This morning I went out to my driveway to find that my car had gotten towed out of the driveway. I just moved into a townhouse that is part of a HOA. When I moved in I read over the the HOA’s bylaws regarding parking. My house is a different situation because it has a driveway. All the other homes go straight from the driveway to the street. All of the curbs (except for flat spot in front of garages) are painted red for fire lanes. The HOA bylaws have two rules: “no parking on red curbs for more than 20 minutes” and “no parking on curbs in front of garage. 
My home is the only one in about 25 or so homes that has a driveway between the garage and the curb. When I moved in, the leasing company said I could park in my own driveway. About two days after moving in, I got a violation sticker on my car when It was parked in the driveway. I furiously decided to read the parking bylaws and it mentioned nothing about parking in my driveway. My car is small and does not extend into the street at all. 

I printed the parking rules and left it on my dash for the last two weeks with a handwritten comment saying “rules do not mention violation when parked in driveway”. It worked for about two weeks and today my car is gone. 

Is there a way to get a lawyer so I can sue or threaten to sue the HOA? I feel like what was done to me is illegal. I currently am in contact with towing agencies nearby to see if they have my car. When I find it I’m not sure if I should pay and get my car back first or talk to the HOA and leave my car there. I have no experience with this. Even as I’m calling the PD to see where the car is, they are telling me that it sounds off that my car was towed out of my driveway and that it isn’t legal in a lot of places.

EDI Called landlord and they referred me to call city police non emergency number where towed cars are supposed to be reported. They have had no record of it all day. Called the community management team and asked if they enforced parking and they said yes. At first the lady on the phone was very cold and stand off-ish. She said I had to have my landlord call (hiding something?). When I asked her why her company’s phone number is on the entrance to my neighborhood she hung up. I got my landlord to call and the community management team said that they didn’t tow any cars matching the description, address, or plates. The designated tow company for my neighborhood also directly told me twice they have no record of it being towed. 

My landlord recommended I file a police report so I did

At this point I think either the car got stolen somehow (it’s a push to start and was locked, plus we live in an above-income neighborhood with low crime) or maybe it did get towed and is at some random tow yard and someone documented it incorrectly. Car is missing... will update soon when more info found.

","&gt;Is there a way to get a lawyer so I can sue or threaten to sue the HOA?

Sure.  You can always call lawyers and see if they're interested in suing the HOA.  In that suit you stand to gain the cost of the tow.  It's not necessarily clear that is worthwhile, and likely could proceed in small claims court. 

What we don't know is if you have a case.  You've interpreted the association rules.  You might start with asking the association to explain to you the rule they believe you're violating and how it applies to your circumstance.  

&gt;I got a violation sticker on my car when It was parked in the driveway.

This would have been the right time to start that conversation.  

&gt;When I find it I’m not sure if I should pay and get my car back first or talk to the HOA and leave my car there.

Pay to retrieve your car.  Stop the losses of accumulating storage fees.  Then pursue the HOA for those costs if appropriate. END"

" Q: Found dog in Nov, prior owner contacted me yesterday wanting him back without compensating back for medical bills.
T: GOOD
B: I found a 5-year-old dog in mid-Nov walking around my neighborhood in Alabama. It was infested with fleas, covered in mats and malnutrition. The dog had to be sedated to be shaved down and went from 26lbs to 19lbs after being groomed under the care of a Veterinarian. He had no collar on when found, no microchip on examination and I posted an ad in Nov for having found him and never received any replies.

Until yesterday, when a lady approached me on a walk claiming it was her dog. I told the owner that I expected to be compensated for the documented care I invested in the dog, which was done with the impression of keeping him. The prior owner said that was my decision and she would not cover the vet bills and it was also discovered at that appointment that he is heartworm positive (going to cost around 600$ additionally to treat.) She self-reported posting on a ""lost pet's"" Facebook group but I have not been able to find it. Based on their interaction I believe that the dog was her's previously but he was not trying to leave with her either and didn't seem to enjoy her son.

The family lives around 5 houses away and I have been walking this dog down the same road around 4-5x/week since I rescued him. She started to threaten to call the cops and I just told her I have bills to show he is my dog. I didn't give the dog back and told her I would come by her house tomorrow to hopefully find resolve. I'm not trying to collect on everything, just the documented bills, where does this stand legally? I got photos of what he looked like before and after his treatments.

","OP:

You might want to first contact the local animal control on the guidelines when it comes to abandoned pets.  While they can not give you any sort of legal advice, they can point out the laws and state statutes that would apply to such. 

Now after you do that, then it would be prudent to find and maybe talk to a lawyer about such, as it sounds like the woman may not have a case at all, but just that way you have one that can defend you in the event she does call the cops.  The fact that you have all of that documentation, from the finding of the animal the posting of the lost animal and the vet bills along with the records of such, would go along way in your favor.  

And you may want to look at the actual state law when it comes to abandoned animals, it was an interesting read and one that could be used in a court, but not to the woman's favor.  If anything keep an eye on the animal and after all of it is done, get it microchipped. END"

I’m in NYC 
I was hired at an animal hospital 2 months ago at 18 dollars an hour. I was told I’d have a review at 6 months. They asked me not to share my pay rate with anyone else, and of course I wasn’t going to.  Well a couple of days ago, another employee opened my paycheck and saw that I make more than the other employees. She shared it with everyone and they all complained to management. 

Yesterday the manager asked if I had shared my pay with anyone and I said no. She said the owner and her wanted to give me a review which I thought was odd but okay. They went through my review trying to pick apart anything I had done over the last few months, including the number of cancellations they had recently which they somehow tried to blame me for even though there’s a pandemic going on. 

At the end; they said they are going to cut my pay to 15 per hour, to match the other employees. When I was hired; I signed a paper with my pay rate on it which was $18. I said that they can’t do that to me and it’s not fair but it seems that they are going to.

","HR Background: First of all, it is not illegal for a company to ask you to keep your rate of pay to yourself. It is illegal, however, to retaliate against an employee who has disclosed that information. I would talk to your local department of labor to see what they have to say about the situation, and also possibly an attorney. If you do speak with an attorney, it would be beneficial to start considering the possibility that it may be more cost effective to just find another job, since it sounds like you haven't actually suffered any losses yet.

Also, it may be wise to start writing down all transactions between you and management. Start by writing down all dates, times, and what was said for any prior meetings. I would start recording all future meetings on your phone (New York is a one-party consent state, so you don't need to tell them you are recording). Good luck! END"

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

**Edit:** Wow, this post has blown up more than I ever expected. Thank you to everyone for your advice regarding my current predicament. I’ve tried responding to everyone, but it’s too much at this point so I will fill you all in with the information I have told others that has been buried in the comments. 

To answer several of your questions, yes I am on my parents’ health insurance. That’s the only financial help they’ve given me. I understand that’s a lot in and of itself. But I have paid for my own rent, utilities, car, phone, gas, food, education, and any other expenses in my name, (i.e. copayments or other medical bills the insurance doesn’t cover). 

Despite all this, I won’t be amending my or my parents’ tax returns. They have done more than enough for me in the past, therefore the least I can do for them is give them a pass on this and prevent any repercussions they might face from the IRS. Instead, I will file as an independent in my 2020 tax returns either by doing it myself or by having a different CPA my parents don’t use to help me do it. All I can do from there is hope I get the stimulus check by then. $1,200 just isn’t worth it to me to fight so much to get, and to potentially burn bridges with my parents. It might be worth it to others in this situation, just not me. I greatly appreciate everyone’s feedback and I hope you all were able to help others reading this post that are stuck in a similar situation. Stay safe out there, everyone.

Anyway, I set up an automatic response saying my emails were not currently being monitored, etc. and today I get a call from my boss asking me why I haven't done this and that. I said to him it was my understanding I cant work while on furlough but if he agrees there is work for me to do then I will come off furlough immediately. He then says no and that I can still work while on furlough providing ""the work is not revenue generating"". I asked him where he got this information from as everything I have searched online states no work or services to be provided for the employer while on furlough. He couldn't tell me and instead started listing the jobs he wants me to complete at home and send to him asap.

Now I don't know where I stand as I know there is work to be done and I am happy to do it, at the end of the day I want a job to return to but I feel like I am being taken advantage of and even worse contributing to something that seems like fraud? 

Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

" Q: Our roommate's girlfriend is underage. We want her out of the house ASAP.
T: GOOD
B: Hi all, this is a bit complex so I'll try to simplify as much as possible.

I live with my boyfriend and his older brother in a home they own together. We're 26-30 years old. About 9 months ago, their family friend Roommate (20M) moved in. We all pay rent, utilities, etc. About 4 months ago, Roommate asked if his girlfriend of two years could move in. Brothers agreed and added $150 to Roommate's rent so that the cost could be split between Roommate and Girlfriend.

Problems begin immediately. Girlfriend is an all around bad roommate. She has no job or savings so Roommate pays the full portion for rent and for food. They both smoke marijuana excessively, but Roommate has a medical marijuana card and works at a smoke shop so we leave it alone. (We don't smoke) Girlfriend never got a key to the house so she just leaves it unlocked while we're all at work. She steals food. She left the backyard after open and let the dog out. Etc.

Roommate and Girlfriend break up because he caught her sending nudes to multiple people. She said it was for money. He said there were no transactions. He makes up excuses about her moving out for a few weeks but she finally leaves.

This brings us to Sunday. We're eating with a mutual friend and find out that Girlfriend is 16. We're all horrified and angry at roommate for dating a minor and not telling us while she was in the house.

When we get home that day, we find her in the house. Alone. No idea how she got in.

So here come the questions. She's still here because Roommate is refusing to make her leave no matter what the brothers say. How do we get her to leave? Does she have any tenants rights if there is no written lease and she never paid for anything?

Roommate is saying she should be allowed to stay because he already paid her part of the rent. He thinks she should stay for a month or two more. She hides from us.

Brothers are considering calling the police to remove her, but I'm worried they could be held liable for her actions since they happened in the house. Underage drug use, distributing child pornography, and statutory rape come to mind. 

Roommate is on probation, but I don't know for what. I don't know how this would affect him.

A friend said calling CPS might help? She didn't have a poor family situation before moving in. She lived with her parents 2 hours away.

Older brother is considering forcibly taking her to her parents house on Saturday while Roommate is at work. I think that could end poorly.

How can we resolve this as safely and legally as possible?
Location is Mesa, AZ.

Edit: Moved city to the bottom of the post.

Update: We threatened to call the police and she left to go to a friend's house until her parents pick her up. As landlords, the brothers told Roommate that girlfriend is not allowed back in the house. As friends, we're trying to get him to cut all contact with her since the relationship is clearly inappropriate. Whether or not he continues living here is up to the brothers. 

I appreciate everyone's advice.

","I'd argue it would probably be best to contact CPS first. While there's a chance her parents are decent people in over their head, there's a much better chance that a child that has such seemingly serious issues comes from an abusive household. 

I know it's a shitty situation and she makes a shitty roommate. But direct the majority of that anger at the adult man that brought a child to your home to sleep in his bed. He knew it was wrong, or he wouldn't have lied about it. END"

",Am I reading that wrong or does it mean that two 17-year-olds who have sex with each other would be registered sex offenders until they turn 25 and that an 18-year-old and a 17-year-old who are both in college having sex would result in the 18-year-old going to prison and being a registered sex offender for life?

","- Call CPS, let them know what has been going on, including that they have had sex, and that the girl has been creating &amp; distributing child pornography 

- Call the police. Your roommate has been committing statutory rape, the girl has been creating and distributing child pornography.

Edit: as another comment pointed out, go to CPS first, the girls actions may be as a result of her home life END"
" Q: Can't collect ""friendly"" loan
T: GOOD
B: I loaned my ""friend"" $6500 a few months ago now he keeps ignoring me completely. I dont know how to proceed, I have no record of me giving him money, it was verbal we shook hands etc 

I know a lot of things about him that can get him in trouble. For example he opened shell LLC company, and used it to get credit from vendors(net-30), wireless contracts with iphones, selling them and never paying any bills. I have screenshots of him bragging how he's using his fake company to get credit etc

If i cant get my money back, can i report him for fraud somehow and punish him or is this just a waste of my time.

","Just as a practical matter, if you're ever again assessing someone's creditworthiness, phases like ""never paying any bills"" and the fact that they boast about scamming a variety of people is not so much a red flag as it is every sign in the universe telling you to run away as quickly as possible.
