When they refuse email them something to the effect of \"in response to your call where you refused to tow an illegally parked car, I followed your direction to park in XYZ spot.\" \n\n3. Contact management about it through e-mail and attach pictures of the car in your spot. (Encourage your neighbors to do the same.) \n\n4. You could leave a sticky note on the car that the next time you see it parked in your spot that you're calling a towing company.\n\n5. I don't know if it would work, but you could try to call another tow truck company to get the car out of your spot.

That includes what happened, what was said, times, etc. Do this while the interactions are fresh. This is to help with writing a letter to the management company and\/or to file a police report.\n\nTry to make sure that any future communication with the rental office is done in writing (or email) rather than phone calls. Once you start doing the written only communication, the apartment knows you are serious.\n\nAt a minimum, what I would want from the office is:\n\n1. Acknowledgement that they gave out her key to a stranger and allowed him to enter her apartment. In writing. \n\n2. What procedures they have put in place to prevent this from happening again. \n\n3. Rekey the locks on her door(s).\n\n4. The rental office will pay for the installation of a tenant lock (keyless deadbolt that only has a knob on the inside) for the tenants exterior doors. This is more secure than a chain (in my opinion). \n\n5. Request the name of the person who entered her apartment. If you file a police report, this would be a good detail to have.\n\nYour friend should check her lease for language about entry to the apartment. They have probably violated any entry notice wait time even though the guy didn't work for the office.\n\nSince the office basically gave out a key to someone who came in and said \"apartment 202\" without confirming this was the correct apartment, resident name, and visitor, I don't think they are really going to be able to tighten up the security in a satisfying way. In the end it may take a letter to the office requesting the lease termination fee be waived and her lease be ended. END"}

Who was it that calculated the valuation of it being worth $1.4 million?  Does the trust document actually have language in it that gives the trustee the authority to sell it or close it?  Verbal agreements are worth nothing when the trust must be administered--the language of the trust must be strictly followed.\n\nDoes the company have a person in charge who is running\/managing things or is that you?  What are the monthly payroll expenses? Someone in the accounting department should be preparing monthly income statements that would show how much per month the business is making in net income\/profit (the money that is left over after expenses have been paid).  Is there enough business cash available for someone to start paying off the credit card debt and the accounts payable?  The $160K in accounts receivable is far too high, but certainly understandable.  It means that the company has been too trusting of its customers to let them go too long without paying their bills on time--you can correct that situation by having someone in the A\/R department to start aggressively making collection calls to ask for your money or by hiring a debt collection company to do the same thing, and if they are successful in collecting this could be a good source of future income for this company.  From this day forward, the customers your company does business for should be asked to put up a partial advance deposit before you do the work for them.  That will be an indication of their ability to pay and their willingness to pay.  Discuss all of these business aspects with the accountant you have worked with in the past (or with an accountant who has experience with businesses) and that person can advise you about what the business should be doing.\n\nYou can not let the beneficiaries or anyone else, prevent you from selling the business.  After you have worked the numbers with the accountant, you will be able to see in black and white whether the business can afford to continue or not.   I'm glad that you were able to at least mention some of the numbers involving the business operations, since that means that you are being informed about what is going on there.\n\nIf the trust does not name anyone to be a successor trustee, then you will have to consult with a trust attorney to figure out how a new trustee can be chosen.  The attorney can also help you figure out how to interpret the will and the trust--they are two separate documents that will be handled differently--the will will be handled in probate court and the trust will be managed privately, outside of court.

If we provide them a check they will be \"destroyed\". \n\nI confronted our LL about this and explained how i am not putting in my information into a random unsecured website. He told me that if i don't use the site then he will personally drag me out of my apartment on August 1st. \n\nFurthermore this company has also told us they will not be doing any repairs or fixing issues due to COVID and instead we are recommended to find a company ourselves and pay them ourselves and they will reimburse us up to a certain amount \"at their discretion\", however will not explain to us what this amount is. \n\nIs this legal?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" So, not a lawyer...

{"prompt":" Q: Elderly neighbor's unsettling behavior is sharply escalating (Vermont).\nT: GOOD\nB: Hey, all. \n\nI live in Vermont. I moved in maybe four or five months ago (time has lost all meaning during lockdown) to a new building. The day I moved in, I met a seemingly-nice old lady. \n\nShe helped me out one day when I was locked out of my apartment, and I left a thank you note and a small candy gift outside her door. Everything was polite and nice. \n\nBut then she started asking favors of me, scaling it up from one quick errand to a significant amount of chores, shopping, cleaning, etc. I told her I was on disability for a reason -- I have both physical and mental health disabilities -- and she made some rude comments insinuating I was lying about my depression.\n\nShe also started to try to sell me on her religion. She wanted to \"lay hands on\" me to \"heal [my] migraines\" and implied it would heal my depression as well. I politely declined and she asked about my family's religion. When I told her what it was and it was different than hers, she made faces and a few disparaging remarks, and ever since then has been trying in earnest to convert me, telling me my family's religion is fake and sinful and we're all going to hell and that my late grandparents are in hell.\n\nBy this time I'd known her for about a week, and she started saying \"I love you\" to me. Repeatedly. And I knew it was time to cut contact.\n\nIt was then that I started trying to distance myself from this woman. I asked her several times specifically *not* to get things for me at the store, but she would come to my door and hover outside it for minutes at a time, listening through the door -- sometimes while I was on zoom doing my therapy sessions, other times right around midnight -- and when I'd open the door to tell her to go away she'd act like she'd just gotten there and I hadn't heard her squeaky walker and shuffling feet come up the hallway ten minutes earlier and stop right outside my door. Then she'd give me things I'd asked her not to buy me.\n\nI stopped reciprocating with thank-you notes and return gifts when she gets me things I have asked her not to get me. I blocked her number and deleted the increasingly passive-aggressive voicemails because they made me uncomfortable (and were also filling up my mailbox). If I saw her in the laundry room and she hadn't spotted me, I'd leave as quickly as I could.\n\nBut sometimes she does spot me, and on several occasions she has blocked my exit from the laundry room or blocked me from going up the stairs to get away from her and gotten right up in my face. It's like a switch has been flipped. She's passive aggressive, she's outright aggressive. This little old lady scares me.\n\nAnd every time she corners me in the hallway, she starts calling me incessantly again. \n\nIt's been four or five months now. I blocked her number about two weeks into all this. Three weeks ago, I sent her a text asking her to not contact me again (she told me she texts her grandchildren and whatnot so I know she got it, she just didn't reply). Today I left a letter on her door. It was not rude, I did not insult her -- it just said something like \"hello, I have asked you multiple times not to contact me. Please stop calling my voicemail, coming to my door, leaving me things, etc. I want no further contact, not even for you to come to see me about this note.\"\n\nThen a little while later I came out of the elevator and bam, there she was. I tried ignoring her but she started following me. I asked her to leave me alone multiple times, but she kept saying, \"no, no,\" and I kept repeating myself: leave me alone. She started giggling madly then, and said in a sing-song, admonishing voice, \"you're *grumpy.*\" I told her I wasn't grumpy and that I wanted to be left alone. She said no over and over again and I tried to leave through the front door when she reached out to grab my arm to stop me.\n\nThat really scared me, as I grew up in an abusive household, and so before I even realized it I had yelled \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" That yell was enough to freeze her for just an instant, and I slipped out the door and out of the building. She yelled after me, \"*I'm going to report you!*\"\n\n**#TL;DR:**\n\nNeighbor lady was friendly at first, then scary. Blocks my exit and gets into my personal space. Does not listen when I have asked her not to contact me. Is now threatening to report me because I yelled at her to leave me alone when she was trying to grab me while I was trying to get away from her. \n\nHow do I go about getting a restraining order when our interactions have been in person ever since I blocked her number?

{"prompt":" Q: Ohio Real Estate Question: what kind of scam is this?\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi All-\n\nMy wife and I own a house that we are rehabbing in one of the big cities in Ohio.  This is not our primary residence; however, once the rehab is done, we intend to move in and make it our primary residence.  We have a mortgage on the place to pay for the rehab, so it's gone through an exhaustive title search.  (With this mortgage and a grant program, there are liens on this house that approximately equal or are greater than its value in its present condition.)  In its current condition, it is not livable- there is no running water, no walls, no flooring, no ceilings.\n\nThis neighborhood is gentrifying and as a result investors really want properties there.  We've had literally hundreds of people call asking to buy the place... we've had lots of complaints to city code enforcement in the hopes that we'd get tired of them and unload the place.\n\nOn Friday, my contractor called me and said that some guy dropped off a weird letter to one of his guys who was working on the place.  He asked me if I knew what was going on, and I had no idea.  The letter is handwritten and it reads:\n\n&gt;July 17, 2020  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NOTIFICATION OF EVICTION  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To whom it may concern:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On this seventeenth day of July 2020, all tenants, occupiers, occupants, residents, dwellers, lessees, and renters are provided a 10-day notice of eviction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The premises must be vacated by August 3, 2020 or further legal action may follow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This property has been claimed by Mr. A--- F--- who can be reached at (---) --------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Candidly,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A---- F----\n\nThe actual property address is not on the letter.

Unfortunately due to Covid, the police department in this city is not doing any in-person contact except for immediate emergencies.  They directed me to leave my number on a voicemail and an officer would get back to me.  I haven't heard anything yet.

{"prompt":" Q: Undercharged Tenant of 35 Years cannot Leave Apt that needs to be Gutted\nT: GOOD\nB: This is New York (not the city). My father owns a house split into two apartments, one upstairs one downstairs. The upstairs is very nice because each of my brothers has lived in it and fixed it up very nice. The downstairs is another story. \n\nThe downstairs has been occupied by an older women who paid about $180-200 35 years ago and increased to what it is today, $300\/month.  She is now in the ending stages of her life. The apartment is also falling apart. She has been delinquent in reporting small issues until they are huge issues, but my dad has always corrected them when he sees them. Now it has become so bad that the entire bathroom needs to be gutted. The floor under the toilet is not sturdy. A leaking issue was recently corrected by tearing open a wall. \n\nTenant wants my father to replace the wall because of course, she doesn’t want to look at it. She asked my father to fix it and he said he needs to gut the entire bathroom, but to do that she would have to move out for a time so it can be gutted and made safe again. She said she will not because she has no where to go. \n\nThe tenant’s adopted son recently disowned her because the tenant’s son and his wife found his biological mom and discovered that bio mom is very wealthy. To curry favor with the bio mom (for some inheritance) the tenant’s son completely ditched his adopted mom (my dad’s tenant) and now the tenant has no one. She receives $600\/month and half of that goes to rent. \n\nMy father has no clue what to do because the apartment is not safe, but cannot be fixed with her living in the apartment and she says she has no where to go. \n\nWhat are his options in this situation? The tenant has been on a month-to-month for decades. I told my dad he should be worried that the apartment is unsafe and if anything happens to his tenant, that adopted, money-grubbing son of hers would sue the pants off of him. What can he do? Just ask her to leave because she is on a month-to-month lease? Does he have to pay for a hotel while he guts the bathroom? \n\nThis seems like a no-win situation, my dad doesn’t want to kick her out, he can’t have her live in an unsafe apartment, he can’t afford to put her up in a hotel, he hasn’t made any profit from the apartment because he hasn’t wanted to ask her to pay more because he knows she can’t pay it. What is he supposed to do to protect himself?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" He has no responsibility to her once she has moved out if he terminates the tenancy correctly. Do keep in mind he is liable for injuries that arose from the current state of the bathroom and unsafe conditions present, which she may bring to a landlord tenant board and have him fined for not fixing. You must give her a one month notice due before the rent date prior where it's effective. So if you want to get her out by Sept 1st you'll have to give your notice before Aug 1st, make sure to do this in writing not verbally, have a paper trail going. The son can sue anyone for anything, but he will have a hard time proving damages. Also this will probably put him in a bind with his rich bio mom if he's all of the sudden coming back to help his adopted mom, so he might just continue on the same path since he is greedy. You're only other option is to pay for a different accommodation for her (like a motel) while the renovations are taking place, but that is a terrible idea financially and you have no lease which requires that, terminating the tenancy is the \"cleanest\" option for you to avoid liability.

{"prompt":" Q: Undercharged Tenant of 35 Years cannot Leave Apt that needs to be Gutted\nT: GOOD\nB: This is New York (not the city).

The downstairs is another story. \n\nThe downstairs has been occupied by an older women who paid about $180-200 35 years ago and increased to what it is today, $300\/month.  She is now in the ending stages of her life. The apartment is also falling apart. She has been delinquent in reporting small issues until they are huge issues, but my dad has always corrected them when he sees them. Now it has become so bad that the entire bathroom needs to be gutted. The floor under the toilet is not sturdy. A leaking issue was recently corrected by tearing open a wall. \n\nTenant wants my father to replace the wall because of course, she doesn’t want to look at it. She asked my father to fix it and he said he needs to gut the entire bathroom, but to do that she would have to move out for a time so it can be gutted and made safe again. She said she will not because she has no where to go. \n\nThe tenant’s adopted son recently disowned her because the tenant’s son and his wife found his biological mom and discovered that bio mom is very wealthy.

I told my dad he should be worried that the apartment is unsafe and if anything happens to his tenant, that adopted, money-grubbing son of hers would sue the pants off of him. What can he do? Just ask her to leave because she is on a month-to-month lease? Does he have to pay for a hotel while he guts the bathroom? \n\nThis seems like a no-win situation, my dad doesn’t want to kick her out, he can’t have her live in an unsafe apartment, he can’t afford to put her up in a hotel, he hasn’t made any profit from the apartment because he hasn’t wanted to ask her to pay more because he knows she can’t pay it.

We are both ambitious people and made the most of our professional development in college by attending company events, conferences etc. At a conference, Sarah met someone that would enter our lives as her mentor, and later would be somewhat of a mentor to me by association. I'll call this mentor Bobby (Male 57 year old). Bobby calls himself a christian man and is very involved in church with his wife as relationship counselors for newly engaged couples. He is also very successful in his career, sits on millions of dollars and has a lot of connections at big companies. Sarah is very strong in her faith and saw Bobby as a great mentor for her spiritually and in her professional development. They began meeting for lunch and discussing personal growth and overall life goals. Before long, Bobby had gained Sarah and I's trust. He was becoming a mentor to me (when I was around Sarah) but never reached out to me like he did with her. We would come to him with relationship advice and trusted his guidance as a counselor, even though he would favor Sarah's side even when she knew she was wrong.\n\nFast forward to us graduating college and starting our careers. Sarah gained gained absolute trust in Bobby and began to see him as a father. Hell, I even looked up to the guy. We were looking somewhere to live in a metro area to be close to work. Bobby lives in a more suburban area away from the metro area, but this didn't stop him from suggesting that we look for apartments in the town he lives. After looking, Sarah decided her favorite apartment was one which was around a mile away from Bobby and his wife's house. I told her that the location was much further away from the metro area, and that it would be mildly inappropriate to move so close to this guy that takes an unusual and eccentric interest in her professional development. After not coming to agreement of a better place to live, Bobby invited her to come sign the lease, and spent 45 minutes on the phone manipulating her into thinking that this was a choice she should make on her own and independent of me. He also suggested she sign the lease and tell me after.\n\nI lost a lot of trust because of this and told her that he was manipulating her, and wanted her close to him. I also thought the situation was getting creepy, and that he had surpassed me in Sarah's loyalty. I talked to Sarah about this and told her that I'd move in, but we need to limit contact with Bobby because he influences her to do things which are not good for our relationship. She agreed. With all the trust I lost over the signing of the lease, I became hypersensitive to what Sarah was doing and was monitoring her, catching her in little white lies left and right. We constantly fought about my loss of trust in her, and with no where to turn we phoned Bobby, who again took her side. He called me and had a one on one after our joint call, and told me that I needed to work on trust. At this point he would come over when I was not there, and help Sarah set up investment accounts. He would invite Sarah to run in the mornings without me knowing the next few days after my one on one phone call, and would say that I am not the right guy for her and that I may be the devil (lol).\n\nA couple of days later, he invited Sarah over to have a one on one with him in person. He said that I can't know about it, and that she needed to hide it. When she arrived he had wine ready out back for them to have their talk. He began saying that Im not the guy Sarah should marry, and that I'm not good for her. He mentioned that he normally mentors people in a few areas, and that sexuality was one of them. He said he and Sarah hadn't touched that topic. He then began asking about sex and pushed for details. Bobby insisted that Sarah didn't know what it was like to be pleasured. He suggested that she needed to leave me and masterbate in a special way to release the pain of breaking up with me. Sarah was starting to feel weirded out, but followed him in the house when he said they needed to talk inside and that he would \"talk her through what he meant\". She asked why they couldn't stay outside, but he insisted, stating that \"nothing would happen in there, don't worry\". She reluctantly followed and sat down on a couch in his basement. He placed himself right next to her almost touching her. She began to cry about our relationship and said that she needed to pray. He placed his hand on her knee and held her hand- I had seen him do this before in a father-daughter fashion when she was distraught. She didn't think much of it until he reached up her dress and tugged on her spandex. She pulled away and he noted that everything was okay and that she didn't need to worry. She continued crying on the topic about us when she suggested maybe she should meditate about it. \"Yes lets meditate!\" exclaimed Bob. He forcefully tugged her in and began to kiss her head, cheeks, forehead and then began to position her head as he went in for the lips.

He was responsible for 90% of the pain points in our relationship, including the problems she felt the need to go to him to. We believe he engineered these predatory moves to groom, gain trust, and isolate her from me.\n\nNote; This man has been married since college, he is 57. His wife was not in town the night of the incident. Sarah told me what happened a day later and that he was out of our life for good. We also payed the penalty to break our lease to move somewhere else.\n\nWith Bobby's status, wealth, and connections to our employers, we are scared to file a police report for sexual assault.

We constantly fought about my loss of trust in her, and with no where to turn we phoned Bobby, who again took her side. He called me and had a one on one after our joint call, and told me that I needed to work on trust. At this point he would come over when I was not there, and help Sarah set up investment accounts. He would invite Sarah to run in the mornings without me knowing the next few days after my one on one phone call, and would say that I am not the right guy for her and that I may be the devil (lol).\n\nA couple of days later, he invited Sarah over to have a one on one with him in person. He said that I can't know about it, and that she needed to hide it. When she arrived he had wine ready out back for them to have their talk. He began saying that Im not the guy Sarah should marry, and that I'm not good for her. He mentioned that he normally mentors people in a few areas, and that sexuality was one of them. He said he and Sarah hadn't touched that topic. He then began asking about sex and pushed for details. Bobby insisted that Sarah didn't know what it was like to be pleasured. He suggested that she needed to leave me and masterbate in a special way to release the pain of breaking up with me. Sarah was starting to feel weirded out, but followed him in the house when he said they needed to talk inside and that he would \"talk her through what he meant\". She asked why they couldn't stay outside, but he insisted, stating that \"nothing would happen in there, don't worry\". She reluctantly followed and sat down on a couch in his basement. He placed himself right next to her almost touching her. She began to cry about our relationship and said that she needed to pray. He placed his hand on her knee and held her hand- I had seen him do this before in a father-daughter fashion when she was distraught. She didn't think much of it until he reached up her dress and tugged on her spandex. She pulled away and he noted that everything was okay and that she didn't need to worry. She continued crying on the topic about us when she suggested maybe she should meditate about it. \"Yes lets meditate!\" exclaimed Bob. He forcefully tugged her in and began to kiss her head, cheeks, forehead and then began to position her head as he went in for the lips. Sarah freaked out and said it was getting late and rushed up the stairs and out the door. \"Well, goodnight then\" mumbled bob as she made her way out.\n\nSarah admits Bobby had groomed her and had an agenda the whole time. He was responsible for 90% of the pain points in our relationship, including the problems she felt the need to go to him to. We believe he engineered these predatory moves to groom, gain trust, and isolate her from me.\n\nNote; This man has been married since college, he is 57. His wife was not in town the night of the incident. Sarah told me what happened a day later and that he was out of our life for good. We also payed the penalty to break our lease to move somewhere else.\n\nWith Bobby's status, wealth, and connections to our employers, we are scared to file a police report for sexual assault. We are also hesitant to even call his wife and tell her. Any advice on what to do moving forward would be nice, as still are inept to wrap our heads around the absurdity of this mans presence in our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDI Bobby was Sarah's professor her senior year\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Im thinking this would be prosecuted as sexual battery. Would you think its also beneficial to file a report in case of any career retaliation down the road? END"}

Hopefully this can still help. The management company I work for breaks down the rent make-up in a strange way due to the accounting system we use. Let’s say the rent base is $2000 and that is on your lease for what your monthly rent should be (before utilities, etc.). The resident would see a $50 balcony charge, $200 water view, $30 third floor fee. All in all, the base rent is still $2000, but the breakdown is given to show what the rent is comprised of. On top of that they would see minor charges for utilities and the breakdown would be there for water, sewer, and common electric charges. Any other “rental items,” like garage fees or storage fees would be tacked on, too.\n\nYou have the right to see what your ledger looks like. Also, compare what you’ve paid in the past to what they are charging now. Definitely comb through your lease. Ultimately, this Covid thing left landlords and management companies scrambling.

If I were in your shoes, I'd probably just ask my doctor to provide a letter stating that (a) the syringes are required for administering necessary prescribed medication and (b) that HIPAA prevents him from sharing any further details regarding your diagnosis or treatment.  Even this kind of letter isn't something your landlord can require, but it would probably be the fastest, easiest way to get him to shut up and leave you alone. END"}

Which is a $4\/hr pay cut. Is this legal? I thought they had to hold my position or is it just a position? Is this constructive dismissal?

I'd recommend filing an OSHA complaint. They may make an inspection, and may order your employer to bring out an exterminator to eliminate the nests. Filing an OSHA complaint is a protected activity, and it would be illegal for your employer to discipline or fire you for doing so.\n\nAside from that, your employer can't *force* you to enter the building, but they can legally fire you for not doing so.

{"prompt":" Q: My father (78) fell out of bed the night he was admitted at a physical therapy\/nursing home in NY. He was admitted in the first place because he has brain damage from a previous fall. We saw a lot of unprofessional behavior the day we dropped him off, and I don't know what to do.\nT: GOOD\nB: Short background: My father had a stroke in 2005 and is paralyzed on the left side of his body. He can walk with assistance from a cane. A few days ago he tripped in my parent's home and hit his head, knocking himself out cold. When he woke up he was confused, not able to speak, and not following directions. He was rushed to the ER and was in the hospital's neurology wing for a few days. They did CAT scans (No MRI) and found that he didn't have a stroke or seizure, hitting his head caused some bleeding in the brain and as it cleared up he was able to speak again. He isn't 100% better, he is still confused and screwing up when talking to people. I feel he was rushed out of the hospital before he was ready to make room for another patient.\n\n He was unable to get out of bed at the hospital, so his muscles got very weak, and he is no longer able to walk unassisted, or in general. His doctors recommended physical therapy, and the day he was discharged from the hospital I, my sister, and my mother drove him to the physical therapy\/nursing home in our car (my mom couldn't afford to pay for the ambulance.) \n\nHere's where the problems start: The admissions manager at the nursing home told my mom they have strict COVID regulations in place to prevent their patients catching it (specifically every patient only works with one nurse) and all patients are placed under quarantine for 2 weeks. Once out of their quarantine the patients would have to be socially distanced, and in their rooms unless in specific communal areas. They told my mom that they hadn't had any COVID cases yet because of these safety regulations, and because they test all of their staff weekly. That all sounded great. But when we arrived we found out that this wasn't the case, and admissions was extremely unprofessional.\n\nWhen we arrived the receptionist told us she was very new. We weren't greeted by any administrators or supervisors. There were nurses walking around the ground floor but they were ignoring us and going home. The receptionist looked up my dad's room, led me and him to an elevator and told us to go up to the ward upstairs. My mom and sister would follow me in the next elevator. I got upstairs with my dad, who by that point wasn't talking much, and walked out of the elevator into the ward. There were patients in wheelchairs, some with masks on, some without, all over the place. There were nurses milling around who didn't even acknowledge that I was there. No one noticed us until my mom and sister came upstairs, at which point they started to yell at us. Apparently the receptionist had allowed us into a closed ward that only patients and nurses are allowed in. They took my dad's belongings, told us a nurse would take care of him, and told us that we had to go back downstairs without him. We did not get a proper chance to say goodbye. \n\nWhen we got downstairs we were told to wait until the night supervisor could meet with us. This was several minutes. During this time another nurse came over to us and said \"I'm sorry, I know this is hard, I wouldn't want to do this with my grandpa either.\" We pointed out that this wasn't my grandpa, this is my dad. We were furious. The night supervisor shows up dripping sweat. She introduces herself,  and explains we weren't supposed to be allowed upstairs but that they'll \"forgive it this time.\" My mom tells her my dad has his medications in his belongings, and that the admissions person said that was fine. The supervisor freaks out, says patients are only allowed to have meds from the pharmacy on site, and runs upstairs to get them. She come's back and we ask her questions about their COVID policies (one nurse to each patient). She looks at us like we're insane and says they only do that for COVID positive people, and asks if my dad is COVID positive. We said no. I asked who the day supervisor would be and she didn't know. She just told us which room my dad would be in, and that he was being helped by a nurse. Overwhelmingly, it was a negative first experience and we were considering bringing him home first thing in the morning. I left thinking they might've lied to my mom about having no COVID patients as well, based on their reaction to our questions.\n\nWhat I need legal advice on: This morning my mom gets a phone call from the nursing home that my dad fell out of bed and landed on his left side (the paralyzed side) and that he is being rushed to the ER in an ambulance. They don't know if he hurt his arm because he can't feel it, or if he hit his head again. There were no railings on the sides of the bed, or anything in place to keep him from falling. We don't know what time he fell, how long he was on the floor before someone noticed him, and if we're going to have to pay for this ambulance now. We don't know who will be responsible for my father's medical expenses if he was injured in this fall. The behavior of the staff was very unprofessional, and I'm concerned there was negligence involved. My dad is in the ER right now, and we don't know his status. I don't know what to do and really need advice. Again, this is in NY state if that makes a difference.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" if your father has any substantial injuries from the fall you or your mom can speak to a personal injury attorney about a medical home negligence suit END"}

If the nursing home takes Medicare or Medicaid, file a report with them as well. Falls are preventable and there should have been measures in place for your father, who should have been immediately assessed as a patient at risk of falls (low bed, rails, movement alarms, pads on the floor, frequent checks etc). CMS and state department of health takes falls VERY seriously. It’s one of the metrics they use to assess quality. Also, any injury related to the fall would be the financial responsibility of the facility, so contact an attorney that can tell you your rights and make sure the hospital bills are covered.

If all else fails, reaching out to the builder might be a good idea.  Let them know that you're having problems with the home you just bought, and they may decide to help.

The pumpkin belongs to the neighbor and the pumpkin is trespassing. I commented this earlier and the AutoMod removed it as “bad or illegal advice.” But the automod is wrong. Source: I am a lawyer licensed in 2 jurisdictions. \n\nHere’s the analysis: the pumpkin plant and the roots are on the neighbor’s property. There is no dispute that the plant belongs to the neighbor. The new pumpkin is still connected to the plant. Therefore, the new pumpkin belongs to the neighbor. \n\nThink about this. If the neighbor had, say, a basketball hoop in her yard, and the wind blew the hoop over, it’s leaning against the fence, and it’s now hanging over the fence and extending into OP’s yard. We wouldn’t dispute that the basketball hoop still belongs to OP’s neighbor even though it’s hanging over OP’s property. So too with the pumpkin. \n\nIf you go onto someone else’s land, or cause another person or thing to go on someone else’s land, that is trespass. You can check the Restatement of Torts. So the pumpkin plant, the property of OP’s neighbor, has entered onto OP’s land. That is trespass. \n\nOP’s remedy is to ask the neighbor to remove the pumpkin, and if the neighbor fails to, then OP could remove it. OP would be on safer ground to do this with a court order, but that’s not likely to be cost effective in this scenario. \n\nThis is the same scenario as when a tree branch grows out over a neighbors yard and then the other neighbor saws the branch off and there’s a dispute or something. The pumpkin does NOT belong to OP. END"}

To release medical records a hospital or doctor needs a signed release from the patient.

For a doctor's office to release records without a release to anyone, much less a third party they had been specifically warned about, is quite surprising.    \nYou should strongly consider finding a lawyer in your area to help you with this. You can file a HIPAA complaint with HHS.  A lawyer familiar with Oklahoma's privacy laws can advise you on whether you can potentially file a lawsuit, and whether the individual's actions are a crime (I don't know Oklahoma's laws on the subject, but in New York this would very much be a criminal violation of a protective\/restraining order).

If the only thing your dad owns of value is the house, it can be handled in a few ways. Adding your names prior to his death has negative tax implications and it ties you to the debt on the property so I don't recommend it at all. It can\/will hurt your credit or ability to get loans in the future because his house debt is now your house debt. Instead he can simply leave it to you and\/or your sister in his will or you can file a transfer on death which means the minute he dies, the property transfers. This leads to the second piece of advice. Get a simple will drawn up. Most lawyers will do it for less than $500 and is important if he owns anything at all. Make a list of every possible asset he has and share that with the lawyer. \n\nSet up a medical power of attorney also. The POA you already set up doesn't cover medical. These are standard documents and can be downloaded from the internet, filled out, and signed. You can also get them from the hospital or your doctors office typically. \n\nIf he has bank accounts, you can file papers with the bank that once he passes, they will transfer to you. Do not put your name on the accounts because it could tie you to his debt if he dies and is not financially on the positive side.\n\nIf he has a car, the DMV should have paperwork available to also have it transfer on death. Again, don't add your name to the title because then it is a liability to you. If he hits someone or something while driving, you are liable and it can also hurt your credit. \n\nBest of luck to you and if you have more questions, feel free to ask. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Wedding venue wants to keep $10,000 in deposits for cancelling due to COVID...\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi! My fiancé and I were supposed to be getting married at a wedding venue in Massachusetts. We had been making payments $17k so far) for quite some time. \n\nMassachusetts by order will not enter into phase 4 of lockdowns until a vaccine is up. So currently, weddings in Mass. can’t have dancing, open bar, shared food items including food stations, and only 25 people. \n\nOur wedding contract is for 110 - 125 people, with catering that includes multiple food stations, food sharing, dance floor for dancing, and a bunch of other things the venue can no longer do due to the government restrictions. \n\nSo basically we can only have 25 people and not much of what we agreed to have. Also, and here’s the kicker, we now live in Florida and the governor has a non-enforced order for travelers to quarantine for 2 weeks...\n\nThe contract has a force majeure clause but the venue says it’s not something we can exercise because they can still technically give us a wedding But will need to modify what we agreed to.\n\nOur argument is that given they can not fulfill well over 75% of the contract due to the pandemic (which the contract actually speaks to an epidemic\/pandemic directly causing force majeure) that it should be void and our payments returned.

{"prompt":" Q: Wedding venue wants to keep $10,000 in deposits for cancelling due to COVID...\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi! My fiancé and I were supposed to be getting married at a wedding venue in Massachusetts. We had been making payments $17k so far) for quite some time. \n\nMassachusetts by order will not enter into phase 4 of lockdowns until a vaccine is up. So currently, weddings in Mass. can’t have dancing, open bar, shared food items including food stations, and only 25 people. \n\nOur wedding contract is for 110 - 125 people, with catering that includes multiple food stations, food sharing, dance floor for dancing, and a bunch of other things the venue can no longer do due to the government restrictions. \n\nSo basically we can only have 25 people and not much of what we agreed to have. Also, and here’s the kicker, we now live in Florida and the governor has a non-enforced order for travelers to quarantine for 2 weeks...\n\nThe contract has a force majeure clause but the venue says it’s not something we can exercise because they can still technically give us a wedding But will need to modify what we agreed to.\n\nOur argument is that given they can not fulfill well over 75% of the contract due to the pandemic (which the contract actually speaks to an epidemic\/pandemic directly causing force majeure) that it should be void and our payments returned. We even said given the hit to their industry we may be open to negotiate (I wanted to offer 1 maybe $2,000 but haven’t yet) \n\nThey basically said the contract is still enforced, they could technically charge us a penalty for cancelling meaning we’d owe them ANOTHER $8k on top of the $17k we’ve paid, but out of courtesy they’ll give us $7k back and we’d just be out $10k\n\nTaking emotions out of it, this just seems wrong contractually and ethically.\n\nBut I am not a legal expert and am currently shopping around attorneys in case they won’t negotiate.

You didn’t contract for a small wedding without the things that you would be losing. If you signed a contract to buy a Ferrari and it was lost or something the dealer couldn’t say “okay well take this mustang instead, it’s pretty fast.” You contracted for specific services, services they can no longer provide through no fault of either party. It sucks for everybody but that is why this clause is there. \n\nThat being said, I do not know how these clauses are treated in MA but a lawyer in that jurisdiction will be able to help there. END"}

Code 89-8-13 provides that you may seek to terminate the lease in the event of a material noncompliance with the lease agreement by the landlord. This states that you need to give 14 days written notice to the landlord describing the breach and that the lease will terminate not was than 14 days after the date of the notice if the breach is not remedied. If they do remedy it, the lease will not terminate. Given this isn’t a typical breach such as failure to repair or something like that, it isn’t clear if there is a way they could properly “remedy” this, aside from making you feel comfortable that it wouldn’t happen again. \n\nIn the event they remedy it, 89-8-13(3)(b) states that if it happens again within 6 months, you can terminate wit 14 days notice regardless of their attempts to remedy. If the agreement is terminated, subsection (4) provides that the landlord shall return all prepaid and unearned rent as well as the security deposit recoverable by the tenant. \n\nSo if you do want out, it may be worth consulting a lawyer as this is both a breach of the lease agreement and arguably the covenant of quiet enjoyment and there is no requirement in the statute that the landlord breach multiple times. The question will end up being whether it was a “material breach,” which a local lawyer will be able to provide more information about. END"}

He wants me to file a claim with my homeowner's insurance.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi all, Iowa state question for you:\n\nLast week someone who lives a street over from me was testing out his new drone. He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.\n\nBy this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog \"vicious\" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.\n\nHe came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.\n\nThis morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because \"dog damaged property\" has a pretty nasty ring to it.

{"prompt":" Q: Leasing office fumbled leaseholder paperwork\nT: GOOD\nB: Location: Jersey City, NJ \n\nSummary: Leasing office did not process paperwork correctly, leaving me as the sole leaseholder and accountable party of a 3BR apartment. Roommate has taken advantage of the legal situation and left the apartment without finding a replacement, leaving us to compensate for his rent.\n\nIn March 2019, my two roommates (A and B) and I signed a lease renewal for our 3BR apartment. A and B joined mid-lease 2019, and were only occupants at this time, not leaseholders. I was the only leaseholder at this time because I was there during the signing of the original lease in 2018. Both roommates were aligned with the lease renewal and expressed long term interest in the apartment. This was right before the virus began to gain speed.\n\nWe wanted to add them as leaseholders before signing the renewal but could not, as the office said that the previous roommates had to be removed from the lease, before adding A and B. After accepting this, I signed and we left that meeting, and contacted my previous roommates. We learned the previous roommates had submitted their lease removal forms last year and it was already processed. I was already the only leaseholder during the time of this signing, and we could have added A and B during the resigning meeting.\n\nTo formalize A and B as leaseholders, we prepared the necessary forms ASAP. However, the office was already closed and we could not submit the forms in-person. We called the office and were instructed to send the representative the forms via email instead. We emailed the forms to the office on the same day. We followed up multiple times with no confirmation that A and B were added to the lease.\n\nWe would not have signed the lease renewal, if we knew that A and B would not be added to the lease. It's a professional courtesy and expectation of the leasing office to acknowledge our application -- either by accepting, or explaining what was missing, which we were willing to immediately address.\n\nBecause B was not added to the lease, he has now taken advantage of the situation. He moved out of the apartment last week without any contractual obligation to pay, and we are forced to compensate for his rent. His room was around 40% of the total rent, and A and I must now pay that, in addition to our current rent. We cannot find a replacement roommate in the current environment, even when offering discounted rates. B refuses to help pay for any months until a replacement is found, or any early lease termination fee, because he was not formally on the lease.\n\nNow that we are working remote, A and I are both living at our parents houses. We don't necessarily need the apartment for the foreseeable future, so we are *okay* with a full lease termination.\n\nI asked about lease termination options in June when B first told us his move out plans, and learned I am expected to pay 3 months worth of rent ($12k+ between A and myself) to terminate the lease. This is unreasonable because of the steps my roommates and I took to explicitly avoid this situation.\n\nI sent an email explaining the situation to the leasing office and the representative two days ago after realizing that we had evidence of their negligence, but they haven't responded.\n\nI've laid out what seems to be the available options.\n\n* Option 1: Leasing office recognizes their fault and gives us some compensation in the form of early lease termination with waived fee, or rent reduction to exclude the third room.\n* Option 2: There is some sort of legal action we can take to be compensated for the leasing office's mistakes\n* Option 3: A and I terminate the lease by the office's terms by paying 3 months worth of rent\n* Option 4: A and I keep paying inflated rent and looking for a replacement. This is the least desirable route because we don't need an apartment, and it is very difficult to find a roommate.\n\n**What action can I take if they choose not to respond?** I don't have much experience in this area, but  we do have records of our emails and any lack of follow up from the office. Thanks for any help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No, the whole point of the contract is that it writes out what each party is agreeing to. There is a doctrine of scrivener's error (when there is some error in the written contract and there is clear evidence that it does not match what both parties agreed to orally). But it sounds the OP and the landlord agreed on a renewal with only the OP on the lease, with a separate understanding that the lease could be modified in the future to include the other roommates. The fact is that A and B signed no contract with anyone. If A and B's names were not on the lease it's basically impossible for OP to say that he thought he was signing a document with A and B's names on it. OP should not have signed the lease until the issue was resolved. \n\nIt's also probably a moot point, because rental agreements like this almost always state joint and several liability meaning the landlord can go after the roommates as a group or each individual roommate for the full amount. So even if B had signed, the landlord can ask OP for the full amount. OP and B have no actual contractual obligation to each other. To protect themselves, OP, A and B should have asked for separate leases, or they should have made a contract with each other regarding who was responsible for the full amount. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Neighbor requests that I maintain a rock wall along our property line, but he later discovers that the rocks lie entirely on his property\nT: GOOD\nB: This takes place in upstate New York. There is a loose rock wall made of large boulders that runs along one side of my property. I assumed that the property line ran somewhere through the middle of the wall.  \n\n\nAbout 12 years ago, our neighbor on the other side of the wall (angrily) confronted me about maintaining the wall. Because I believed that the wall was partially on my property, and because I wanted to avoid further conflict, I have been pulling weeds and gathering miscellaneous trash between the boulders every year since. The property line is fairly long, so cleaning the rocks is a weekend-long project. My neighbor does not contribute to maintaining the wall.  \n\n\nRecently, my neighbor had his property surveyed. He discovered that the property line runs along the edge of the rock wall, with the boulders entirely on his property.  \n\n\nSince my neighbor has indicated to me in the past that he believes that the rocks are my responsibility, and since I have been working to maintain the wall for &gt;10 years, do I have any legal claim to the rocks and\/or the property the rocks are on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Neighbour confronted OP on the presumption that it was his property and he was not maintaining it.

In May 2020, we received their letter of intent to renew that detailed the increase in rent and no other changes. At the time, we wanted to renew, so we signed this letter of intent. However, we recently received the new lease for September 2020-2021, and it contains new Landlord provisions that feel predatory and that we do not feel comfortable with.\n\nWe asked the landlords to change the provisions, they declined, so we let them know we will not be signing this new lease and will not be tenants for this upcoming year. They are now coming back and claiming that our letter of intent to renew is legally binding for the next year and we will be responsible for the whole next year of rent until they find new renters.\n\nIs a letter of intent legally binding even if they change the terms of the agreement FAR after the fact?

{"prompt":" Q: HOA vs. Neighborhood Association (MI)\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Michigan. I recently received a visit from the president of our neighborhood group about my yard. We have a couple signs up, which are apparently not allowed under the rules. He told me he had received a complaint. We had also been looking into building a fence soon, which he said is also against the rules. This visit is the first step in rule enforcement.\n\nHere's the thing: A number of people in our neighborhood insist that we have a neighborhood association and not an HOA, and thus it is voluntary and they have no power to enforce the rules (including someone on the board). They say only one new phase of our neighborhood has an HOA and it is a completely different organization because it is only now being built 60 years later (that is another story). I asked the president whether our organization was voluntary or not, he gave me a non-answer. I asked him what the penalties were if we failed to comply and he said they could not put a lien on the house, but the next step if we didn't resolve it would be to get lawyers involved. I know that at least 1\/3 of the residents don't pay dues, many people of signs (political or otherwise) and there are other rule violations all over (e.g., storing boats or trailers).\n\nWhen we moved in, we were told by the previous owners that this was an HOA and we signed something as part of our closing saying it was mandatory with annual dues, which we paid last year under that impression. This paper was not from the association, it was from the sellers as a disclosure. Those folks didn't live here long so I would not be surprised if they were misled.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How can I be sure whether this is an HOA or a voluntary neighborhood association?\n2. If it is voluntary, did the \"mandatory\" paper or paying dues lock us in forever somehow?\n3. If it is voluntary, am I within my rights to ignore the rules?\n4. Does the selective enforcement matter? I doubt we're being discriminated against in any illegal way, I think we just have a neighbor that dislikes us that complained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to add info:\n\nAt this point, I doubt anyone will see these edits, but I did some digging. In MI, HOAs have to file with the state and file annual reports. The earliest available was 2007, in which the organization described itself as a neighborhood association. In 2009, it began referring to itself as a homeowner's association. I contacted the county and there are no deed restrictions related to an HOA, just public utility easements. At this point I am worried that the seller's addendum could lock us in somehow to this seemingly non-HOA that presents itself as an HOA.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. If it is a HOA it must have written bylaws which will detail an annual meeting, how board members are chosen, your appeal process, etc. Lack of that you don't have one.\n\n2. If it is voluntary, I would assume it is just that, voluntary, but I have no experience in this particular question.\n\n3. I would think you could just ignore it\n\n4. Selective enforcement matters a lot. We had this issue in an HOA i was a resident of in Michigan. The previous board had ignored most of the bylaws. When the new board tried to enforce rules, many residents threatened to sue. The HOA hired an attorney who advised us we needed to \"grandfather\" in anyone who was allowed rule infractions without consequence or any future attempts to enforce would be thrown out.\n\nI have served on HOA boards and was a past president of the neighborhood HOA I lived in. The rules are very specific in Michigan and the boards cannot run their own little kingdoms. I would demand, in writing, a copy of the bylaws. If they don't exist, I would ask where they believe they receive their authority. I can't imagine a situation where your town or county would support any enforcement without bylaws in place. There must be a written process that is ALWAYS followed for rule infractions, otherwise they have no legal standing to enforce against you. As a side note, in an actual HOA, at closing you sign a form that says you have received the bylaws and agree to their contents. Without that i am not sure how you could have a legal and enforceable HOA.\n\nI am not an attorney, but play one on the internet. Seriously though I do have a number of years experience living in HOAs and serving on their boards.\n\nHope that is helpful END"}

{"prompt":" Q: HOA vs. Neighborhood Association (MI)\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Michigan. I recently received a visit from the president of our neighborhood group about my yard.

We had also been looking into building a fence soon, which he said is also against the rules. This visit is the first step in rule enforcement.\n\nHere's the thing: A number of people in our neighborhood insist that we have a neighborhood association and not an HOA, and thus it is voluntary and they have no power to enforce the rules (including someone on the board). They say only one new phase of our neighborhood has an HOA and it is a completely different organization because it is only now being built 60 years later (that is another story). I asked the president whether our organization was voluntary or not, he gave me a non-answer. I asked him what the penalties were if we failed to comply and he said they could not put a lien on the house, but the next step if we didn't resolve it would be to get lawyers involved. I know that at least 1\/3 of the residents don't pay dues, many people of signs (political or otherwise) and there are other rule violations all over (e.g., storing boats or trailers).\n\nWhen we moved in, we were told by the previous owners that this was an HOA and we signed something as part of our closing saying it was mandatory with annual dues, which we paid last year under that impression. This paper was not from the association, it was from the sellers as a disclosure. Those folks didn't live here long so I would not be surprised if they were misled.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How can I be sure whether this is an HOA or a voluntary neighborhood association?\n2. If it is voluntary, did the \"mandatory\" paper or paying dues lock us in forever somehow?\n3.

The only thing I would add is to be very clear who this guy represents  (HOA vs. Neighborhood Assoc), and that he in fact is their representative.  To be an HOA president, as u\/Justahotdadbod alluded to, you have to be elected according to the HOA rules, and he can't just be saying, \"I'll do it, if no one else will.\"  Those rules will spell out the conditions upon which you can be elected, and there are probably requirements and restrictions like term limits, the existence of a quorum, etc.  Verify this person is who he says he is.\n\nAlso, its a good idea to go to your HOA meetings fairly frequently.  Helping keep your HOA on the right track pays off in the long run, and you end up knowing who's who. END"}

It's not something I agree with and it's unfair to workers, especially when they're put in a position where they are never really free to enjoy their time off, but it's the decision federal court has upheld.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/tools-and-samples\/hr-qa\/pages\/cms_020208.aspx\n\nGenerally, it seems like the biggest difference between engaged to wait and waiting to be engaged are whether you're required to remain within a certain proximity of the job site.\n\nEdit: However, OP may still qualify as engaged to wait depending on the frequency and amount of phone calls they are answering.  For example, if they only have half an hour to an hour between phone calls, they could make an argument that that they are not free to enjoy that time and are engaged to wait.  On the other hand, if they only typically receive one phone call a night, the rest of their time could be waiting to be engaged.  I doubt that just having to check the phone once an hour would be considered interrupting enough for this to be engaged to wait. END"}

They’ll feel like they got out of having to give you double pay, and you’ll have gotten everything you actually wanted (and maybe more!). \n\nWhat they’re asking for isn’t necessarily unreasonable: they just don’t want you to sue them if you get covid-19 and get really sick\/end up with medical debt.

Is she legally entitled to the money?\nT: GOOD\nB: GA, USA.\n\nThey were not married. They were both over 18 years old. He left no will. He gifted her the money on the pretense that his bank account had been compromised and that he was moving the money into hers for safe keeping. His family has not asked for the money back outright, but they are pressuring her into giving it to them to pay for funeral services, among other things. If she elects not to give them the money, does his family have the right to sue her for it? I am worried if she withholds the money, they will threaten legal action in order to coerce her.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If he told her he was moving it to her account for safekeeping it does not sound like he told her it was a gift. And it's not a gift causa mortis for the same reason\/ in addition, most state statutes defining a gift causa mortis require death to be an external event. Georgia says, \"must be in his last illness or in peril of death;\". So it's debatable whether such a transfer would be upheld as a gift. It's likely that the money will be found to be part of her estate. Finally, as a baliee of that money, she may have extra duties or liability if she fails to return it. END"}

I live in a building with coin operated laundry, so I've been having a tough time getting laundry done lately with the US coin shortage. On Monday I gave it another go, and stood in line at the bank for about an hour. They told me there was a one-per-customer limit on the quarter rolls, so I gave them my $10 bill and went home with a roll. After struggling trying to get the washing machine to accept the quarters - I realized more than half of them were Canadian coins! For anyone who doesn't know, the Canadian 25 cent coins are the same color, size and shape as American quarters, but coin machines won't take them.\n\nI went back to the bank, waited in line again, and explained my situation to the teller - who told me that there was \"no proof\" I had purchased the coins from the bank (to be fair I definitely didn't ask for a receipt for purchasing a roll of quarters), and said they weren't allowed to give me replacement quarters. I paid in cash so there's no record of the purchase on my bank card.\n\nI realize there probably is no available course of action outside of complaining about it to the bank; I'm just upset I basically threw my money away (and still can't do laundry lol).

It's a long transaction and, with the exchange rate, you'll only get back 19 cents (as of today) per Canadian quarter, BUT you'll get money back AND make the teller go through a long, PITA transaction for an absolutely petty amount of money.\n\nBefore you do that, I would also see if you can speak with the branch manager about the issue, but frame it in a \"this is just so weird, but you may want to give the central vault a head's up that their coin machine is not catching Canadian quarters\" way. They may just make it right for you. If they don't, then file the formal complaint and do the currency exchange.\n\nHaving worked as a bank teller, I can think of 2 ways this would have happened.\n\n* Less likely: the central vault for your bank in your area let the CA quarters slip through\n* More likely: another bank customer rolled their coins at home (either not catching the foreign coins or putting them in deliberately) and deposited them. With the coin shortage, the branch is not able to send as many coins as they normally would, so when this person deposited coins, they were immediately used by the tellers without sending to the vault first for verification. This is against protocol, but when there is a shortage, the branch will use whatever it can to get through the day.\n\n\\*Edit: foreign currency exchange is highly bank specific. Some have minimum amounts, some will not accept coins, some have certain branches that are handle foreign currency,, and some don't deal with it at all. Check with your bank to see if they will exchange foreign coins for US dollars. END"}

A tenant should understand at the beginning of their tenancy what exactly is be considered “ordinary wear and tear.”\n\nSecurity Deposit\n\n&gt;Tenants should do a pre-move in and a pre-move out inspection of the premises. The landlord can deduct from the security for “ordinary wear and tear” but must account for those deductions in writing. Additionally, the tenant is entitled to the return of their security deposit twenty-one (21) days after they move out. If a landlord withholds a tenant’s security deposit in bad faith, they may be liable for the amount of the deposit and up to twice the amount of the deposit. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Great Uncle has installed a metal door and possibly listening devices in great-grandmother's home (among many other things). What can I do to help her?\nT: GOOD\nB: I can't even believe that this is a story I'm currently living through because it is that insane. At this point, I fear for my family member's lives and my great-grandmother's wellbeing. \n\nHere is the main point we are at right now:\nMy great uncle (great-grandmother's son), let's call him Paul. Paul has come home to Pennsylvania from Florida to visit, along with his wife and her children. While here, he threw away an unknown amount of items from her house, possibly took items home, and installed a huge metal door with fencing around it (imagine the metal doors that stores in bad neighborhoods use to close up at night) at the top of her stairs which lead to the attic. In the attic is his childhood room, which previously held 0 possessions of his. There is also a second bedroom and attic area full of my great-grandmother's items, such as winter clothing, home decor, christmas decor, painting supplies, and way more. She is now unable to access them.\n \nThis door was installed WITHOUT My great-grandmother knowing and without her approval. I am unsure if she approved him to get rid of or take any items. My brother believes he found a listening device in the home but that is not confirmed. I would not be surprised if Paul is listening and waiting to fly back at any moment.\n\nA little more background:\nMy brother has been staying at my my great-grandmother's home nightly for the past couple months. Her husband passed recently and it was more so she could have company. He stayed in what used to be Paul's childhood bedroom. Paul and his wife stay in that room when they visit, so my brother cleaned it out but still had some of his clothes, a TV, an Xbox, and money in the room. This was all put away and shouldn't have hindered on their stay. \n\nThis infuriated Paul. He threw my brother's items down the stairs. Told him to get everything and leave. Told him he is not welcome on the property ever again. He has gotten in his face screaming. We do not know why to this day. My brother is 18 and is beyond beside himself. He has been bawling and trying to figure out what he did wrong. \n\nMy brother's girlfriend has also being staying in the home, with permission from my great-grandmother and her own family. Together, they have been helping my great-grandmother clean, cook, and keeping her company. \n\nOn the night that Paul told them to get their stuff and leave, my brother and his girlfriend both went to the house to do just that. While there, Paul's wife grabbed a hold of my brother's girlfriend by the back of the neck. She said, and I quote, \"Come here little bitch. Paul, do you want to see me beat a little girl's ass?\" This occurred in front of my great-grandmother and the wife's children. My brother's girlfriend did not retaliate, she got away and went outside. She had done nothing prior and only said \"I'm going to get my stuff and am leaving.\" \n\nPaul told my brother he is not allowed to step foot on the property. And if he does, he will find out and he will do something about it. I believe the exact words were \"there will be to hell to pay.\" Paul does not own the home, the land, or anything. It will not even be left to him in the will because it is now owned by the bank. \n\nThere is more that has occurred, but these are the major items. During all of this, my great-grandmother sat back and watched. She never asked Paul and his family to leave. I believe she is too afraid to do anything about it, but she has not admitted that. \n\nSome background on Paul:\nEx-army, ex-policeman, teaches gun classes, always carries. He has killed people (in war and as a police officer) There is a lot of bad family history as well. He is scary. My family does not visit our great-grandmother when he is here because we are afraid of him. I do not put physical harm or shooting us past him. \n\n\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I can't help because my great-grandmother isn't taking any action. I would love to know if there is something I can do to help her, to make him not be able to come back here. My family is afraid to go to the cops because my brother has been in some (minor) trouble in the past. I keep saying that doesn' tmatter but they are against it. Paul's wife is \"sue happy\" and would instantly try to make a case against us. And paul is very knowledgeable (or seems to be) in the legal system that I want to make sure my I's are dotted and T's are crossed before I do anything. \n\nI'm so worried and so afraid. Any advice is beyond appreciated. I will provide more info if needed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This sounds like a few issues going on.  Kicking out your brother was potentially an illegal eviction .  Threatening your brother is a potential police issue.  Taking advantage of your great-grandmother is potential elder abuse and theft.\n\nHow sound-of-mind is your great-grandmother?  Some of these behaviors (adding a locked door so Paul could have an apartment) are potentially okay if your great-grandmother is okay with it and competent to make that decision, but it sure seems like a red flag for potential elder abuse.\n\nI would recommend contacting Adult Protective Services and the police.

Even if your brother was staying there as a squatter without permission, he would still usually have tenancy protections (depends a bit on the state).  Though I'm assuming he had permission.  Even without rent\/rental agreement\/etc, he is still considered under to the law to be a tenant.\n\nIf your brother was living there for a chunk of time (depends on the state), to force him to move out requires a formal eviction, which requires a court order and then the police come to remove the person if he still refused to leave.  At no point would the owner or Paul be allowed to physically throw out someone that is living there.  Even just restricting access to the house by changing the locks or something would constitute an illegal eviction.\n\nHer being of sound mind probably changes the outcome a bit, but I would still recommend contacting adult protective services and the police even if only to get their advice and feedback.

The second thing isn't legal. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: What are my rights as a pregnant employee at a small (5 person) company in PA?\nT: BAD\nB: Just found out I'm pregnant and terrified because the company I work for consists of 5 people, and as I understand it I wouldn't be covered under FMLA because of this. Do I have any right to continue working at my position or can I be let go for being pregnant? For reference I do some physical labor, infrequently, and am mostly at my desk for which my \"condition\" would have no effect on my work. I reside in PA. I have heard rumors from past employees that someone was let go when they revealed they were pregnant (unsure how true this is).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" *Your post may have been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\n**Speculative, Anecdotal, Simplistic, Off Topic, or Generally Unhelpful**\n\nYour comment has been removed because it is one or more of the following: speculative, anecdotal, simplistic, generally unhelpful, and\/or off-topic.

{"prompt":" Q: Boss Says I Dont Make Overtime\nT: GOOD\nB: I am 18 years old and I work at a restaurant in Connecticut. I have been working 60-70 hours a week at my job as Both a waiter and bus boy. On my check I only had my 19 Hours as a waiter and my tips. The rest was given in cash which was not as much as I was expecting. I asked about my overtime pay to which my boss laughed and said you don’t get overtime here. I complained and eventually got some more money but not much. She claimed that she was saving me money on my check by giving me half in cash but I believe that I’m not being compensated fairly for the amount of work I put in.

I would like advice on how I can calculate my checks starting now to make sure I am not being screwed over by my employer and underpaid.

The outcome you're looking for is to have a family move out of your neighborhood because they have a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder who has caused problems and now killed your dog. There's really no legal avenue that includes forcing people to move outside of some very specific situations that don't apply here. The fact of the matter is that people have a right to have a home, even if they're shitty neighbors. The most you can really hope for is the child being placed in a residential treatment facility, but you're really not in a position to influence that at all. The most you can do is call CPS, but I can almost guarantee you that somebody at the child's school is aware of his baseline functioning, and he's either not a candidate for inpatient treatment, or he is but there's not a bed available. \n\nI'm a dog owner and mental health professional.

{"prompt":" Q: Dentist is attempting to extort my partner after (unfinished) work has already been paid for in full. Please help.\nT: GOOD\nB: First time posting. Edit: we are in Texas.\n\nI will try to make this long story short:\n\nMy partner has already paid IN FULL for her permanent implant bridges AND HAS BEEN WAITING FOR FOUR (4) YEARS for the service to be completed. This man recently hopped from one office to another across the metroplex (come to find out he was responsible for the downfall of the previous one) and it was here (2nd location) that she was finally molded for her permanent implants in July of 2019. She waited for months until she was finally scheduled for the install at the beginning of March. THE MORNING OF HER INSTALLATION she received a call that her permanents were not at that location, and were instead at a NEW location back across the damn metroplex. WTF.\n\nThen this whole pandemic outbreak begins- important detail.\n\nSuddenly, while she's waiting to receive a date to receive her implants, she gets a call from a brand new clerk at this guys brand new dental clinic. This clerk states that she owes another $2,600 (now she's stating $6,500) when she has already paid $32,000 lol. She was the recipient of a grant and paid out of pocket in the first two years. In full. Not only does she have the paper work to back that up, but the paperwork this clerk sent her doesn't even account for all the money. There's something like $5,000 missing from their documents. My partner has all the paperwork so it's a joke that these people are trying this. The clerk repeatedly (we have recordings) requested my partner come in to discuss this in person AND stated if she came in the dentist could just finish the work. My partner declined because 1. Sketchy and 2. Coronavirus. She knows for a fact (via paperwork, receipts, and previous office clerks) that she owes no money and is certainly not going to risk entering the public for the uncertainty of actually receiving the implants.\n\nGets weirder:\n\nOver the years she developed a personal relationship with this guy because he did in fact save her life with the surgery he conducted prior to developing her implants. She has always contacted him via personal cell phone and has even had appointments off the books, like when the first office would be closed for the day, just so she could get the care she needed.\n\nYesterday her temporary bridge broke, which is a huge problem if it falls out of her mouth because she will be unable to eat or even speak. So, she texts her dentist this morning letting him know it broke and asks when she will be able to receive her permanents. He beats around the bush, claims he needs to install new temporaries instead of the permanents he claims to have with him, and states that she needs to COME IN, IN PERSON to discuss this \"cordially\" with the front desk clerk what she \"owes\" stating that \"he's just a contracted dentist and not aware of finances.\" Discuss what? Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something?

Make it as simple as possible: my grandmother locked me out of my house, stole my jewelry and clothes, and stole all of the money from my bank account.\n\n3. Let her contact list know what happened.\n\n4. She can sue them for wrongful eviction, defamation and conversion. The state in which you live changes the amount you can get back significantly. In California, she could sue for triple what was stolen from her, per Penal Code section 496 subd. (c), and one hundred dollars per day, see Civil Code section 789.3. You can also seek a prejudgment writ of possession\/writ of replevin (again depending on state) for her jewelry and other things. I would personally sue in limited jurisdiction with a fee waiver (again assuming California), rather than small claims, because it is much more procedurally difficult to defend a limited jurisdiction case, if they try to defend themselves without a lawyer you can probably win by default by just slamming them with requests for admission and then moving for summary judgment, and you have the right to a jury trial and appeals. YMMV, again, depending on your state. END"}

(Technically, you could sue or threaten to sue the bank, but there is roughly 0% chance that is going to be useful.)\n\nFrom many of the comments you have made, you are expecting that they should not have placed a hold on the money because it was an \"on us\" check -- a check from the same institution. There ARE fairly recent banking regulations that control \"on us\" checks[1], but they guarantee next-day availability not same day cashing of the check. If your father had not had an account (which he did -- as a joint with you) they would not have been able to hold money from the account. If your father had simply deposited the money then returned the next day to withdraw it they would have had to make it available (but still could collect from your checking or savings account LATER if the check turned out to be bad). But cashing it as he did I believe they are entitled to hold the money (make it unavailable for withdrawal).\n\nThe next question is how long they are allowed to hold the money for. Here, the times you have been hearing from the bank sound normal. Most are resolved within a few business days; some cases take as long as 10 days.\n\nWhen this is all over, you may want to consider removing your father from the account if you do not have a reason to want him as a joint on it.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/regulations\/compliance\/manual\/6\/vi-1.1.pdf END"}

Is there anything that I can even threaten them with, legally? This doesn't seem right.\n\nTL;DR — Due to bank error, I have $2,000 missing from my account. It has been 6 days, and it still hasn't been returned, despite the time frame they quoted me coming and going. Do I have any course of action?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" &gt; So it should have been taken directly from his account, no?\n \nNot necessarily. There’s no requirement that they treat it as a conversion\/cashing rather than a deposit. \n \nThe key here is that the check transaction was treated as a deposit. Checks don’t clear immediately, regardless of where the account is. The bank can likely chose to honor it immediately - but fake check scams are popular enough that tellers are trained to try and help their customers. \n \nThen there was a separate withdrawal of $2000 cash against your account and processed immediately. \n \nAsk your dad for the cash, then pay him when the bank credits your account.\n \nChecks shouldn’t be considered immediate instruments. All check based transactions should be treated with a 14 day hold.\n \nAgain, dad should open his own account at the bank that he uses frequently. END"}

The epidemic is not an excuse to steal people's money or let people steal money from  you. \n\nNow I'm going to infer some unsaid stuff here, but if you said that because the idea of confronting them about his induces anxiety, I fully understand. However, if that's the case, I would like you to try this: write down a list of 10 things you could buy with $470. Each thing on the list could be one item (like a new phone), or a group of items that add up to about $470 (like 47 lunches at the sandwich shop you like), or even a mix of items (like a new toaster oven, ten fancy coffees, and whatever), but put together a list of ten of them and write them down. \n\nNow, look at each item on that list, and ask yourself \"If I already had this and these jerks asked me to hand it over, how would I feel?\" Of course you would be shocked and angry that they would even suggest it!\n\nOk, now that you're pissed off, go get your money back. I'm sure other commenters will tell you how. Sounds like you've already found the applicable laws (if not, do a search for \"tenant's rights\" and the name of your town, county, or state). As already mentioned, you may even be entitled to more than the deposit if they failed to return it in a timely fashion. If so, that penalty is also already legally yours. It already belongs to you by law. Make them hand it over. END"}

If you report it to CPS, they may investigate it. I say may because I'm not sure it rises to the level of CPS intervention yet. When they investigate it, they will open a file on you, your mother, your mom's boyfriend, and your dad if he's still in the picture. If they feel the need to intervene but not enough to remove you, all will have to go through a safety plan together. That could mean all sorts of things, typically it's you all using whatever resources CPS has in your area, that could be workshops, programs, therapy, etc. If they feel removal is necessary, you will be taken out of your mother's house, your parents will become defendants in a suit brought by CPS where they allege you've been neglected\/abused by your parents and you all will have to go through whatever reunification program CPS sets up for you. Yes, reunification, because that's the ultimate goal of CPS, to reunify the family. With you being 17 you may never even get to complete that program because CPS doesn't have jurisdiction over adult children. If you you have any siblings in the home, they could be affected as well. If CPS gets involved and wants to to take action, you all no longer have any control over what happens. You may not get placed with the family member you'd like to live with. You and your parents may have to do things you feel aren't necessary. You aren't guaranteed the same lifestyle you're currently living in. \n\nI'm not going to tell you CPS is bad option. If you feel you're in immediate danger, it is an option you can take to protect you, but it's an option you have no control over. If you feel like your mother has sufficiently handled it and you don't want the possibility of the above to happen, then maybe that's as far as you need to take it.\n\nEdit: Some of you need to slow your roll. Stop telling OP that this guy is definitely going to escalate things. You don't know that. You can't predict the future. Stop feeding the fear. Also, stop telling OP that she absolutely has to tell the police and CPS. She doesn't. It's her life. You don't get to dictate that.

Since I will be out of work, my coworkers and I all wanted to file for unemployment. However for the past month, my employer has done something rather shady.

What’s likely happening is they’re trying to keep paying you as long as they possibly can before they have to lay you off. This probably allows you to keep insurance\/other benefits you may have as well. California considers PTO to be an earned wage, so when you leave a job they have to pay this out to you in your final paycheck or an additional check. This may just be their way of paying you all out for any PTO you had on the books. Have you spoken to them about it yet? Are they planning layoffs? END"}

The court will not be open until at least 23 days after the citation was written, so what do I do?\n\nFailure to respond to the citation within 10 days will lead to a default judgement and suspended license according to the back of the ticket. I don't want to pay the ticket and have my insurance increased because the court is closed and does not have an answering machine to leave a message. I sent an email using their website, but it will not send me a confirmation email, so that is not much help.\n\nHow should I go about managing this?

{"prompt":" Q: Being sued personally by a customer of the store where I work. Says she slipped on the floor I was cleaning and she's injured.\nT: GOOD\nB: I'm a cleaner at a supermarket. On january 16 I was working, I was cleaning a closed-off section of the store. I was cleaning the floor so it was wet. Suddenly someone started shouting and a lady was saying that she slipped on the floor and fell and that she was in pain. I helped her get back on her feet she walked alright. She was in the \\*closed-off\\* section so not supposed to be there and there were signs. Then my manager came to talk to her. She was protesting but he said that the section was closed-off then they talked some more but I don't know what was said because I went back to work. Last thursday in the mail there was a letter, it's from a lawyer saying the lady was seriously injured and had to go to the hospital and she's asking for $24000 or she will take me to court personally for her injuries, hospital costs and now she's disabled. At first I didn't even know who she was then I remembered. It didn't look like she was badly injured when she was talking to my manager. I'm just a cleaner I don't have that kind of money. I was just doing my job as told by my manager and following all the rules and the lady was not supposed to be where she was. Don't know how she got my name and address. We have name tags but with just our first name. I don't know why she's coming after me personally and not the store? What can I do? There's no way I can pay that kind of money.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" They should have sent it directly to the company. But in my experience as an adjuster, a personal injury lawyer might do it this way for a number of reasons:  \n\n- They may have just made a mistake.  \n\n- They may believe based on their client's story that the employee is personally liable for some reason.  \n\n- They may also be trying to scare the employee into a personal settlement. This is less likely because usually these PI lawyers are *actually* targeting the insurance money. They know a janitor probably can't personally pay the amount they want. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Getting evicted because of snoring problem.\nT: GOOD\nB: *I originally posted this somewhere else and some suggested I post it here. Based in NYC*\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1\/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is “old” with medical issues, he said there’s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.\n\nWe have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn’t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.\n\nThe next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we’d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their “safety”. \n\nSo we’ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our “loud talking” at night.\n\nMy question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused.

It would be nice to take a video using the decibel reader inside your home to measure how loud the snoring is in units that lady doesn’t live in. You have time to gather evidence since evictions are currently halted. I’m a sleep tech, and I agree that she should get a sleep study. She clearly doesn’t use a cpap already or her snoring would be gone or extremely quiet. Not to mention that untreated sleep apnea causes heart problems. This lady is going to have a heart attack, stroke, or both if she doesn’t start using a CPAP. END"}

When you get your court date, bring all your paperwork you have regarding custody, ACS paperwork included. If you lost the ACS paperwork, call the case worker or at least the office they used to work at and get someone to get you a copy of the forms. These will give you an established timeline for when you started having custody. then the Child support Should be modified to show that you started with custody on \"x\" date and they will calculate from there. Someone has to pay support, so more than likely they will order her to pay something. That amount will be back dated to the day (or should be) that you took custody from ACS. Make sure to have all your paystubs, bank records, tax forms and anything else financial with you when you go.  If this is overwhelming, look at legal aid in your area and see if they can get you a lawyer to help.\n\nif you do nothing they will make you pay her  and even take you to JAIL for not paying. \n\ngood luck END"}

What do I do?\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in New York City.\nMy sons mother abandoned my son. I got a phone call from ACS one day and the ACS worker informed me that my sons mother wanted to give my son up because she couldn’t handle him anymore. (my son has autism) The ACS worker asked me if I was interested in taking custody of my son. I said yes and we arranged for everything to happen that weekend. I signed papers and was told I had custody of my son. I didn’t know any better so while I was still receiving letters claiming that I owed child support I thought nothing of it and thought the paper work was slow to catch up. I thought the same with his SSI checks when the ACS worker told me she told his mother that she had to go report that she was no longer the payer for my child. (No ssi checks for 3 months until I personally went over to see what was going on and found out she was still receiving the checks for him and still cashing them).\n His mother disappears off the face of the earth for literally 2 years. When she does pop back up she says she wants visitations. We go to court and that’s when I find out I didn’t really have “full custody” in their eyes because the paper work was from an ACS worker. But His mother didn’t dispute it. She said I could have full custody, she just as wants to see him once in awhile. We get through that, I’m told nothing about the ssi money she practically stole and gave him none of although I asked about it and even said it in court. I also told my lawyer(public defendant)about the child support issue.I’m being charged arrears and monthly fees for two years now. He said it would be in the final judgement yet the court papers I received do not state this and the public defendant no longer answers my calls.(side note: I lost my job and a lot of other things once I became a full time father. Autism isn’t easy, my son had a difficult time living with his mother his first 8 years. He wasn’t provided any help from city services or even special education because his mother didn’t find the time to get him the help he needed. No therapy, no nothing.

I don’t see how she would be entitled to that money in anyway possible when she wasn’t the one caring for him therefore she shouldn’t have been receiving his benefits. Benefits she used for her herself that were entitled to my child\n\nIn the courts view it was never notified that the balance of custody and parental duties had changed and a modification of the child support order was necessary. It's not the courts responsibility to chase down and check-up on every child support order and ask them \"is this still relevant?\". That's on you. When you received the first letter saying you owed child support, that should have been your first cue to follow up with the court, even if you thought someone else was taking care of it for you.\n\nChild support is also for the custodian of the child, and while its intent is to be used for the child's support and upkeep, they aren't entitled to the money.

Until you do, your ex is entitled to that money, as crazy as that may sound. All that matters is that child support order.

Or are you talking about some kind of money that's given because your child has special needs? \n\nRegardless, until you go back to court and get a real custody order giving you custody and change the child support order, you're still going to be racking up arrears.

{"prompt":" Q: My 85 yr old grandma is in a rehabilitation center, being incredibly abused by staff. It’s taking forever to get her transferred to an assisted living place. Medicare says if I take her out of there myself, they won’t cover the 1.5 weeks she’s been there.. but I need to get her out.\nT: GOOD\nB: We’re in Ohio. She was transferred from the hospital to this rehabilitation center 11 days ago. The entire reason she was sent there is to gain back the physical strength she lost while sick with pneumonia. In the entire time she’s been there they haven’t gotten her up once.. which is literally the point in her being there. They haven’t bathed her, or changed her clothes. She’s still wearing the same unwashed underwear and bra from 2 weeks ago. Instead of getting her up to go to the toilet, they’re making her crap her pants and sit in it for HOURS. They’re mean to her. They were even mean to us.\n\nThey gave her a double dose of sleeping meds and benzodiazepines to make her easier to neglect. When she’d call us, she would just moan. She couldn’t speak. That’s how drugged up they had her. When we ordered them to stop, she went back to normal. They turned the ringer\/outgoing calls on her room phone off for almost a week so we couldn’t reach her. When we called the front desk, they said she’s fine, just can’t talk. But she wanted to talk to us very badly, but couldn’t. There’s not even a working tv, she’s been staring at the wall this whole time. She’s weeping at me on the phone begging me to get her out.\n\nAnd Medicare has the audacity to say they won’t cover the tens of thousands of dollars this abuse will cost my grandma if they don’t. Can they really do this? Can they really refuse to cover the medical costs if we save her from abuse?\n\nHer life is in danger. When we visited, she pressed her call light and it took them 90 minutes to answer it. She has a condition that can close her throat and make her unable to breathe at any time. What if that happens while she’s here?? She’ll die...\n\nI am contacting her lawyer ASAP. But considering it’s Easter I have no idea how long it’ll take and I need to get her out immediately. Like now, or worst case scenario in the morning. Can her insurance company really stick my grandma with the bill for abuse if I get her out? This place shouldn’t be paid at all.\n\nEdit to add we are NOT in a covid-19 outbreak area. There are barely any confirmed cases in the whole county- there are zero cases in this facility. This is not the reason for the neglect.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not necessarily no but a lot of the time it comes down to a combination of understaffing and nurses and CNAs being very underpaid. We're thankfully that at the facility I'm at that we have staff who want to work and do their job well, so we've never had any abuses cases that I'm aware of.

{"prompt":" Q: Someone Shot Our Dog (Ohio)\nT: GOOD\nB: Yesterday, someone shot our dog.  we live in a suburban neighborhood, houses on lots of around .5 acres in Ohio.  Lots of cul-de-sacs and single family homes, very little access to major roads.  We had two dogs, both black with white and brown coloring on their chest and faces.  One long hair and one short.  My wife was heading outside to do check the weather to prep for some gardening around 11AM on Saturday 4\/11, and neglected to fully latch the door.  The dogs pushed the door open and bolted.  Both are very fast, she ran inside to get her coat and shouted for me.  The dogs ran about a block and turned left, where we couldn't see.  When she got back outside, maybe a minute later, she found one dog coming home, more slowly, when he froze and collapsed about one house away.  I managed to catch the other one with the help of a neighbor about a block further away.\n\nWe got the dog home, and he was immobile, and struggling to breathe.  He's an older dog, around 11, and the other is around 3.  We thought at first that he was struggling to keep up with the younger dog or he was hit by a car, and the adrenaline got him halfway home, until we noticed a little bit of blood on his paw.  We took him to an emergency vet, they treated him for shock and x-rayed him, and found what appeared to be a pellet lodged in his abdomen, they also found the entrance wound.  He expired about two hours later.\n\nWe called the county dog warden, and posted to NextDoor (a local social networking app) asking for information.  The Deputy took our statement and the veterinarian information, and began  questioning witnesses.  Someone reached out on NextDoor the next day to report seeing it happen.  They saw two dogs in a neighbors front yard, heard a loud noise, one of the dogs yelped, and saw two men walk out of the garage facing that front yard a few moments later.  We gave their information to the Deputy, and he took a statement.  The Deputy tells us that because nobody saw a weapon or the specific act, and the folks who \"were implicated would not come forward\" he can't move ahead with charges.  The location that the witness claims to have seen the dogs matches the timeline, and location of the dog when he collapsed.\n\nMy Questions:  \n1) Given the existing evidence, is it even worth pursuing a civil case in small claims for veterinary bills and replacement costs for the dog? (Roughly 1100 in medical bills plus some nominal amount for replacement)  \n2) If yes, what are the steps involved in collecting the statement from the neighbor?\n\nFor Example:  \n a) Should we get a signed statement?    \n b) Would it be admissible in small claims court without the witness being present?  \n c) Should we have it notarized?  \n3) Should we hold off on a civil case, and continue to escalate the criminal case with the proper authorities?  \n\n\nThank you for your advice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Guy shot his neighbors dog.

If our dog was threatening or violent, I would agree that shooting him is justified.  If our dog was running down the road as witnesses are telling us, I would not agree that a shooting is justified.\n\nAt this point, I think our best course of action is continuing to assist the Deputy Dog Warden in his investigation.

It never happened.  12 years later I'm still here and I haven't made a single mortgage payment.  As you can imaging during this time I also fell behind on my property taxes.  Eventually I was able to pay off the delinquent taxes, and I've continue to pay them on time every year since.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not even sure who owns my house anymore - no one has even mailed me anything about it.  I looked it up on the county records and I'm still listed as the owner.  \n\nNow to my question - frankly the house is too big for me now and I'd like to downsize.  My kids have moved out and my wife passed in 2016 - I just don't need this house.  The county thinks I own it, how do I tell them I don't and I've just been living here rent free?  Ironically, I'm worried if I just leave no one will pay the property taxes and then I'll have a new problem to deal with.\n\nThanks!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sell it on Craigslist “as-is, cash only, no trades, need it gone ASAP” END"}

It's your child's money and she can't use it for personal gain.\n\nBiological paternity is irrelevant. I don't want to pry into the particulars of your situation past where you're comfortable, but if you were married to the other biological parent at the time of\/immediately prior to birth, signed a birth certificate, or signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, you're the legal father. \n\nUTMAs aren't conditional. Once money is transferred, it's transferred. Attorneys are free to send demand letters for any reason (I wouldn't send one in this circumstance, since I find it to be morally repugnant, but that's on the lawyer). They can't compel a paternity test without a court order. \n\nKeep in mind that Idaho does recognize grandparent rights for visitation. That said, your child's old enough that a court is unlikely to force him to visit the grandparents. If you need to go no contact or give them a time out, that'd be a reasonable thing to do. I would keep copies of any correspondence concerning paternity, the attorney's letter, etc. I'd also assume all future discussions concerning this were recorded and would just flat out refuse to discuss the matter until served with legal paper.\n\nRegarding the UTMA - if they try to loot the funds it would make sense to speak to a lawyer and file a police report.

{"prompt":" Q: Mentally ill man invaded our home, caretaker just watched\nT: GOOD\nB: So this happened yesterday. My brother and his girlfriend came to visit us and our kids for the first time since quarantine began (they've been isolating entirely and so have we, we decided to take the slight risk to finally see family for a day). Normally, we keep our doors locked, but this time we left the front door unlocked for a bit after they arrived. My brother and I are both big dudes, so I feel pretty comfortable having the door unlocked for an hour or so. After a bit, we were all hanging out in the rear of the house (the front door opens to a short hallway next to the stairs) talking, and nothing is amiss. At one point, my wife noticed the front door was cracked open. We assumed my brother hadn't quite closed it all the way. She poked her head out to make sure our cat hadn't run out, and noticed a man we've never seen in our neighborhood before, just sitting in his car right across the street from our house, looking at her. She gave him a weird look and closed and locked the door. \n\nA HALF HOUR LATER, it's time for our youngest to take a nap (he's 2). She gets him up for a piggy-back ride upstairs, and as soon as she gets upstairs she starts absolutely screaming \"There's someone in our house!\" Apparently some guy was in our nursery, just sitting in my wife's rocking chair. So while my brother ran upstairs, I grabbed a weapon. My brother physically forced the man downstairs and out of the house, and when we tried to get him to stop and sit down, he just wanders off. Didn't run, didn't speak, just slowly walked off in a daze. The man across the street starts yelling \"It's okay, he's with me,\" etc. and between the confusion of that, and the fact that we don't want to be grappling with strangers during a pandemic, we didn't restrain the man. Probably should have, but we were all just shocked. \n\nAs the intruder wanders down the street, the other man starts telling us that they're from a group home in the area, and he's the guy's 'caretaker' or something. He said he was with him, WATCHING HIM TRY OTHER HOUSES in the neighborhood. He won't give us a reason why he didn't stop the guy, or call the police. Something about \"I thought he knew someone around here\" was the best we could do, but his accent made it difficult to understand everything. He just didn't seem concerned at all about the fact that a man, who was apparently in his care, had just let himself into a stranger's home during a pandemic, and hung out inside for a half hour.\n\nUltimately, the police came and got all our information, and after a bit of a search, they did find the man and take him into custody, thankfully. The guy seemed to be pretty out of it, we couldn't tell if he was extremely drugged up or just really mentally incompetent, but the caretaker told us he was 'psychotic' so that makes me feel even worse. I suppose, as home invasions go, we're thankful that this was an ultimately benign incident, but we sure won't feel right for a while. Obviously we'll be more vigilant about locked doors going forward, and the odds of this are pretty minimal, but I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. (Yes, we fully disinfected the kids' room immediately)\n\nMy plans are: Get the name of the group home and speak with them directly. I want assurances that his 'caretaker' is fired, at least. I'd also like to press charges against the caretaker, if possible. Any functioning adult should have known that what was happening was wrong and done something other than sit outside and twiddle their fucking thumbs. I'm not sure charges against the intruder are very useful, if he's mentally incompetent. I'm also curious about whether a restraining order is a good option? I've contacted the police and requested some follow-up, and was told that tickets were issues, but I'm not sure how much that means. We're in Michigan, btw. Is there anything else I should be doing?

I was sent a consent form with teeth #30 and #19 to be removed in order to take this prescription. I signed the consent and scanned it back to the office. I took the pill as prescribed and it did not have any effect on me that I could tell. I let them know I felt nothing when I arrived for the procedure. I felt rushed through the paperwork when I went inside and was told \"we need to hurry we are behind\" (it was 7:45 AM). I paid what I owed in cash, for both teeth. I was given nitrous through a mask and felt nothing. I began to cry (because I wasn't feeling safe) and try to speak to the nurse, but she continued to hook me up to monitors and talk to people outside of the room.  I told them they would not be able to find a vein in my right arm, but they attempted anyway. The dental surgeon came in and found a vein in my left arm and started the anesthesia. Before I fell asleep, I heard the surgeon ask which two teeth to pull.\n\nWhen I woke up, they had pulled one tooth. I immediately asked what happened and they responded that they could not keep me asleep long enough to pull the second. I refused to leave without seeing the surgeon, but they called in my boyfriend (he had driven me) and I was walked to the car. When I was at home with my prescriptions, my boyfriend informed me that they had walked out to his truck and said: \"she is finally asleep, do you know what teeth we are supposed to pull\"? I was livid. I slept through the weekend and called them on Monday. At no point in the conversation did they tell me they had to ask him what teeth. They DID tell me that I TOLD THEM the wrong teeth numbers so they didn't know which ones. I asked if they had my records and my X-rays and they confirmed. I asked why they didn't consult the records and they said \"you signed the consent for the wrong tooth\". I hung up and contacted my dentist. She confirmed that my records were sent on March 1 again and seemed upset. Later, she called me back stating that I should trust the surgeon and schedule another appointment to have the other tooth removed. I called the surgeon and did just that. They informed me that I would have to pay again. I argued this. They stated I would need to pay for anesthesia, and because they couldn't keep me asleep, I would need to intubated, which would be more expensive. I stated that I already paid them in cash to remove two teeth. I asked them \"did you not remove the second tooth because you didn't know which one or because you couldn't keep me asleep\"? They refused to answer this question and transferred me to fiscal. They informed me that they \"knocked $200\" off the price and will be charging me $150 for the second procedure. They also informed me that they called after the procedure to check on me and spoke to my boyfriend because I was sleeping. This never happened.\n\nNote that this is not strictly about money. I am at a loss of what to do now. Do I have a case? Why didn't they check my records? Why did they not consult with me before they put me to sleep? Why did they not look at the X-rays that THEY took? Am I basically losing here because I signed a consent for the wrong tooth? I didn't even know teeth were numbered until this point. I am afraid to go back to them.

{"prompt":" Q: Dental surgeon didn't know what teeth to pull...asked my boyfriend.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi, this is a throwaway for various reasons. I'll keep this as short as possible and will answer questions if necessary. I also don't post to reddit normally, so I'm sorry if this isn't right or is formatted weirdly.\n\nI was referred to a dental surgeon by my dentist who I very recently began going to. The referral was originally for one tooth that needed to be removed and would eventually become an implant. X-rays were taken and sent to the surgeon. I called both offices to confirm. I went to a consultation, during which I explained to the surgeon that I woke up during other oral surgeries and that I do not react well to anesthesia. More X-rays were taken by the implant surgeon. While waiting for the removal appointment, I had a filling come out on the other side of my mouth and it ended up needing to also be an implant. Again, X-rays and updates were sent to the surgeon on March 1.\n\nThe day before my procedure, I was given a prescription for something to \"relax\" me. I was sent a consent form with teeth #30 and #19 to be removed in order to take this prescription. I signed the consent and scanned it back to the office. I took the pill as prescribed and it did not have any effect on me that I could tell. I let them know I felt nothing when I arrived for the procedure. I felt rushed through the paperwork when I went inside and was told \"we need to hurry we are behind\" (it was 7:45 AM). I paid what I owed in cash, for both teeth. I was given nitrous through a mask and felt nothing. I began to cry (because I wasn't feeling safe) and try to speak to the nurse, but she continued to hook me up to monitors and talk to people outside of the room.  I told them they would not be able to find a vein in my right arm, but they attempted anyway. The dental surgeon came in and found a vein in my left arm and started the anesthesia. Before I fell asleep, I heard the surgeon ask which two teeth to pull.\n\nWhen I woke up, they had pulled one tooth. I immediately asked what happened and they responded that they could not keep me asleep long enough to pull the second. I refused to leave without seeing the surgeon, but they called in my boyfriend (he had driven me) and I was walked to the car. When I was at home with my prescriptions, my boyfriend informed me that they had walked out to his truck and said: \"she is finally asleep, do you know what teeth we are supposed to pull\"? I was livid. I slept through the weekend and called them on Monday. At no point in the conversation did they tell me they had to ask him what teeth. They DID tell me that I TOLD THEM the wrong teeth numbers so they didn't know which ones. I asked if they had my records and my X-rays and they confirmed. I asked why they didn't consult the records and they said \"you signed the consent for the wrong tooth\". I hung up and contacted my dentist. She confirmed that my records were sent on March 1 again and seemed upset. Later, she called me back stating that I should trust the surgeon and schedule another appointment to have the other tooth removed. I called the surgeon and did just that. They informed me that I would have to pay again. I argued this. They stated I would need to pay for anesthesia, and because they couldn't keep me asleep, I would need to intubated, which would be more expensive. I stated that I already paid them in cash to remove two teeth. I asked them \"did you not remove the second tooth because you didn't know which one or because you couldn't keep me asleep\"?

I'll try to be helpful but there are some gaps here in your provided information.   I know this isn't legal advice but it doesn't sound like there's a legal remedy to this.\n\nFirst, you don't say what the actual problem with Expedia is?  Or what you believe it may be?  Is it that their customer service unhelpful and slow?  Yes, it's awful and I saw that as someone who used to work there.  I never bothered with customer service and went directly to the airline carrier when there was a problem because ultimately they own the inventory they sold through Expedia.  Expedia just provides the platform to access the inventory.   So, it would be helpful to understand where you believe the problem may be with Expedia's service?\n\nSecond, have your daughter double-check that the confirmation she received from the carrier is actual.   Confirmations come directly from the airline and they issue the serial code for the confirmation, Expedia only sends this information along to the person who bought the ticket.   The first thing to determine is that there wasn't a breakdown in confirmation from the airline itself and that the confirmation number she was issued by the airline is valid.   It's rare but the airline can sometimes issue an invalid confirmation serial, which is an error on the airline's part and not Expedia.\n\nThird, you are much better off attempting to fix this through the carrier directly.  It's their seat in their plane and their issued ticket.  Expedia customer service will be an intermediary in trying to make a change to a ticket or correct a problem but if the problem didn't result from Expedia's handling, they're also relying on the carrier to agree to a fix.  This is usually successful, but sometimes it's not.  \n\nIt's much better to work through the carrier 99% of the time.  If the customer service agent for the carrier tries to send your daughter back to Expedia, have her insist on speaking to a supervisor with the carrier. END"}

If they were unable to refund the original ticket,  then they should have applied it to this new ticket. Exchanges are more complicated,  which is probably why they couldn't get it done during the initial call. I'd first check my credit card to see if the difference was charged,  and if so, there is likely a ticket number referenced on your statement (Should  begin with 001 since it is an American ticket).

{"prompt":" Q: [CA] CPS took my newborn son over a presumptive positive cocaine test\nT: GOOD\nB: \\[TL;DR: My son was taken away by CPS over a presumptive positive while still at hospital. The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\\]\n\nMy son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.\n\nIn this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to \"neonatal abstinence syndrome\" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.\n\nAt the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son \"tested positive for cocaine\" \\[not presumptive\\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said \"I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.\"\n\nBy the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.\n\nI find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to \"this is routine, we always change the case worker\".\n\nDesperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.\n\nMar 4th \"Jurisdictional\" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.\n\nI start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.\n\nFinally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says \"I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted\". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!\n\n2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says \"based on the \\[egregiously err'd\\] report I still find your son should be withheld\". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says \"mom is denying the allegations\". He says \"Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th\". My lawyer tells me I've made things complicated.\n\nI thought this nightmare would end on Friday &amp; I'm still in utter shock it didn't. I live in SoCal where there aren't many attorney options I can find, or resources to help me. I'm a DACA \"dreamer\", all my family is in the UK. I'm stuck in a nightmare situation.\n\nI haven't had more than 15 minute video chats with my son since they took him. I have a good home, full of baby supplies, gifts, and cute clothes he's already grown out of. I took his crib out of my room because I cried every night looking at it. I've never even had a speeding ticket, never touched cigarettes or alcohol while pregnant, and have never done drugs, yet my lawyer keeps telling me the \"bar is very low\" under dependency law - I just don't understand how I am still here.\n\nI wish I had good questions. I guess they are:\n\n* Is there anything I should be doing differently? I am told appeals court rarely goes against the lower courts.\n* Is there grounds for a civil case that would maybe help motivate someone to help me on contingency? [I found this news article](https:\/\/www.theledger.com\/news\/20200311\/mother-sues-hospital-over-false-positive-drug-test-that-led-to-child-abuse-probe)\n\n\\[Minor note: My friend helped me with this post and it's his account - I don't rape sloths!\\]\n\n###\n\n","completion":" &gt;I don't know why you feel the need to be smug, but \n\nOr why you feel it necessary to engage in personal attacks...\n\n&gt;you have absolutely no way of knowing if the multiple organizations covered by LAAC will provide resources to someone who has inadequate representation. \n\nYou are assuming \"inadequate representation\" which is not a fact at this point.  There's been a detention hearing.  That's it.  This case is at the earliest stage, the criminal equivalent of an arraignment, and it's far from established that OP's representation is inadequate in any sense of the word.\n\n&gt;You're completely speculating, and in doing so potentially spreading misinformation to a person in need.\n\nCan you point to a single legal aid organization in CA that provides services to people with public defenders?  Just one?  Because I've been doing this for a very long time, and I've never heard of one anywhere in the state.  Not for criminal law at trial or on direct appeal, and certainly not in the far more specialized area of dependency, where there aren't that many practitioners in the first place.\n\nI think it's unfair to OP to have her making dozens of queries to organizations that obviously can't help her, but please, if you know of *any* that provide services in dependency cases where the parent already has an appointed PD, please, enlighten us, and I'll happily stand corrected.\n\n&gt;I would check your ego along with my spelling chief.\n\nIf you're holding yourself out as a criminal attorney, I would think you would know the difference between council and counsel and would want to correct an error so you don't look foolish.

{"prompt":" Q: [CA] CPS took my newborn son over a presumptive positive cocaine test\nT: BAD\nB: \\[TL;DR: My son was taken away by CPS over a presumptive positive while still at hospital. The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\\]\n\nMy son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.\n\nIn this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to \"neonatal abstinence syndrome\" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.\n\nAt the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son \"tested positive for cocaine\" \\[not presumptive\\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said \"I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.\"\n\nBy the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.\n\nI find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to \"this is routine, we always change the case worker\".\n\nDesperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.\n\nMar 4th \"Jurisdictional\" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.\n\nI start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.\n\nFinally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says \"I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted\". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!\n\n2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says \"based on the \\[egregiously err'd\\] report I still find your son should be withheld\". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says \"mom is denying the allegations\". He says \"Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th\".

My car smells like vanilla and I’ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he’ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don’t comply he’ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin type skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.\n\nI’m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I’m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?\n\nI have a GoPro in my car but idk if it caught this on camera I didn’t check yet.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I just recently saw this on line - you can set up your phone to record stops.

She used the word \"rights\" a lot and the general theme was that I had no right to tell her to blah blah blah. Then I felt the spit hit my eye. She didn't actually hock a loogie at me, it was just spittle that came out as she was screaming like a banshee. I stopped backing up and she ran into me. I was immediately in a rage, staring her in the eye, so close to hitting her. I think she could tell because it stopped her for a second and she took a step back. I threw my basket down hard and walked away (my sincere apologies to the Target employee who had to clean up my stuff). She yelled something at me but I don't know what it was, my ears were roaring.

{"prompt":" Q: Mail is being withheld from us for a “dangerous dog hold” on a dog that is no longer living.\nT: GOOD\nB: This may be long winded so I’ll add a TLDR at the end. This has been an ongoing matter for about a year now. Initially, we got a red card in the mail saying “dangerous dog, mail withheld” on a dog that had been at our residence for 10+ years. For whatever reason, the carriers decided the dog was too vicious and asked us to move our mail box away from the door (2 inch thick wooden door WITH a security screen, just as the postal service mandates) even though there was no way of him getting out. So, we complied and moved it to the fence along side our driveway, about 5 feet from the public sidewalk. All is well and we continue to get mail. Then, about 4-5 months later, our dog dies (old age, RIP). We kept our mailbox in the same spot UNTIL we noticed mail and packages going missing. Presumably they were stolen because of how easily accessible the mailbox was at this location. So we moved the mail box back to its original spot that it had been in since this house was built in like the 1940s. Again, all is well until about a month later, we receive ANOTHER “dangerous dog” notice in our mail box with no mail. We go to the post office to speak to the post master and ask “what dog are you referring to?” and we couldn’t get an answer. They just keep saying “move your mailbox”. We tell them ma is being stolen but they don’t care. Now the post master is being deliberately rude. We’ve spoken to multiple people including the post master and consumer affairs and they keep saying “we’ll have to come to a decision”. The dog is literally in ashes. There is no viable reason to withhold mail on a dog hold for a dog that doesn’t exist. So now, we have to go to the post office multiple times a week to pick up our mail, during a pandemic I might add. Sometimes they can’t even find it and we have to come back another day. But here’s the part that really set me off. This morning I go in and pick up a weeks worth of mail and I’m going through the stack and I find a bright yellow card that has our address on it, in bold letters on the bottom it says “do not deliver this card” so it’s obvious this is for the use of the post office only. On the back of the card, written in marker in all caps its says, “DOG HOLD FOREVER LOL”. It actually says “lol” at the bottom. Someone very obviously made a mistake by letting this get lost in my stack of mail. This proves to me that this isn’t a legitimate issue and they are just being petty for the hell of it. What can I do here? I refuse to move my mail box and let my mail continue to be stolen. What is my next step to get this resolved?\n\nTLDR: Mail withheld for dangerous dog. Dog dies, mail still won’t get delivered. Petty note found in mail when I l picked up the mail from the post office.

{"prompt":" Q: Am I Responsible For a Single Bed Bug Found In My Apartment? (Michigan if that's important)\nT: GOOD\nB: A few months ago I found a single bed bug in my laundry basket it was un-fed and could barely move, this made it easy to capture. I took a picture and sent it to our land-lord, he came by to verify and had an exterminator come by two days later. When the exterminator he asked us if any furniture was new, we told him our couch was new, and he proceeded to check it along with the rest of the furniture and their crevices. He found absolutely nothing; he wanted to spray so we complied. Before we left the apartment for three hours, I asked the exterminator where he thinks the bed bug came from and he said \"It probably hitched a ride on someone outside and ended up in the laundry room, where it then found it's way into your clothes\".\n\nA few weeks later the building manager sent me a text saying that the exterminator would be coming back in a couple of days for a second inspection. When he arrived he was not alone, he was with our land lord. After the exterminator re-checked our furniture and found nothing, the exterminator said he wanted to spray again and the land-lord not the tenant gave him the go ahead to spray again.\n\nFast Forwarding to the beginning of June, I get a bill for seven-hundred and five dollars. Five Hundred for the pest treatment (the two treatment sprays, one forced by the land lord after nothing was found), two-hundred dollar service fee to the apartment , and a five dollar late fee for every day late even though this was my first time seeing this bill (its much higher now).\n\nNow this is where my lease comes in. Under the section titled PEST CONTROL it says:\n\n\" The community is being treated on a regular basis. You are asked to assist pest control efforts by maintaining a high standard of good housekeeping. Residents with pets must pay an additional charge for de-fleaing. Bed bugs, fleas, cockroaches that are found in the unit or surrounding units and\/or common elements of the property are to be treated at the resident’s expense. \"\n\nIf I'm responsible for treatment then can the land-lord request the exterminator to spray at my expense if nothing was found? The building manager has also told me that I'm required to pay because the exterminator determined the cause was my couch (even though he found nothing twice and previously said the cause was the laundry room). Also the lease says nothing about a $200.00 service fee (the apartment company literally did nothing). The property is also not treated on a regular basis. Can I fight any of this?

{"prompt":" Q: Being held responsible for mother's Ohio welfare debt from 1985\nT: GOOD\nB: I am trying to find out if this practice is truly legal.  In 1985 my mother was receiving welfare.

You signed a new contract with T-Mobile.  Verizon probably automatically terminated service when they got the port request.  As a rule, balances on devices come due upon termination of service.\n\nNow, when you say you cancelled the order, did you get a confirmation email?  Did it say the whole order was cancelled or just the delivery?\n\nAt the end of the day, depending on what was \"cancelled\", you may very well owe the $900.  However, in that case they do owe you the phone.\n\nYour best recourse is to call Verizon and tell them you cancelled your order, and that you shouldn't owe anything (unless you had a balance on the phone you had).

A medical consultation.  So, the medical team is doing business in his rented space.\n\nTo carry your analogy even further, its worse than if the owner slept in his bed.  Its as if the owner let a person sleep there that came to get a test for Covid-19.  They might be or might not be infected.  But they made the bed before they left, so he wouldn't know that anyone had even slept there. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Commercial Landlord continues to use space after leasing\nT: BAD\nB: I have a friend who is starting an insurance company.  Being a startup, money is tight.  But they subleased some office space from a medical office.  It's basically one large room with its own entrance within the large medical office.   They just kept the door from their area closed from the rest of the medical office.\n\nIt was a 6 month lease, to see how things went.  My friend moved in, got set up, and got to work.\n\nThen, Covid-19.  He and his partners stopped going into the office, because of the stay-at-home orders. (This is in North Carolina, by the way.)\n\nBut the other day he dropped by the office to get something.  He walks into his space, and it is full of people from the medical office.  Who are now doing a brisk business testing patients for Covid-19.\n\nHe didn't say anything that day, but just got what he came for and left.  Then he got angry as he drove.  He feels that they probably have been using his space for quite a while, since he hasn't been using it for around 3 months.\n\nBut he ***has*** been paying his rent, on time every month.  There are only two months left, and he wants out without paying those last two months.  His rent is $1,000\/month.\n\nI believe there are several factors in his favor: \n\n1) Their use of his space, for who knows how long or often, &amp;\n\n2) Possible Covid-19 contamination, and re-contamination every time the medical personnel \"reinvade\".  (My friend's wife had cancer, and the chemotherapy did a number on her immune system, so Covid-19 is a real worry for them.)\n\nHe was angry enough to clear out all his stuff within days.  He isn't going back, but doesn't know if he has a leg to stand on if he doesn't pay the last two months rent.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If im reading this right, the medical office leases the full property. The medical company is subletting this out to his friend because assuming they had no use for that space at the time. If this is the case his business is with the medical company directly as they have been using a room that he was paying for without permission. END"}

Nothing too substantial yet but we're talking about a very entitled person who has been passive aggressive ever since we moved in. In addition, our main bathroom has a major plumbing issue which causes the tub and toilet to clog every couple of months. She has acknowledged the issue is from the poor piping, as repeatedly pointed out by the plumber. She has done nothing to fix this issue even though she promised to handle the situation months ago.

{"prompt":" Q: Coworker physically assaulted me at work and HR has done nothing about for a month. [MA]\nT: GOOD\nB: I’m not sure what I should do about the situation, or if this sub is the right one to post on, but let’s see. I could use some direction. I’ve revised the story a bit and withheld names and other identifying info. \n\nThe incident occurred at the beginning of June. After having a conversation with my boss in the late afternoon after the incident, we both decided that the assault should be reported to HR, and so I filed the complaint the next morning. \n\nThe assault took place in an office shared by 8 employees. Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don’t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated. So imagine my shock when this employee sicks a blow to the back of my head. \n\nThe employee is “untouchable”, as in, he’s the best man we have on the floor (almost a supervisor) and he’s gotten away with many things in the past.

I’ve revised the story a bit and withheld names and other identifying info. \n\nThe incident occurred at the beginning of June. After having a conversation with my boss in the late afternoon after the incident, we both decided that the assault should be reported to HR, and so I filed the complaint the next morning. \n\nThe assault took place in an office shared by 8 employees. Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don’t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated.

I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.\n\nI've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO\/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our \"HR\" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.\n\nDecember came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.\n\nThe company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss\/ceo\/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.\n\nUnrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.\n\nI have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.\n\nMy review was with our CEO\/owner and our \"HR\" yesterday. He essentially leads the entire meeting, telling me that I was a great find for the company, came at just the right time when I did (called me a \"miracle\"), and then proceeds to say that my role is has not become what he wanted it to be and rather than letting me go back to my old position, they are going to \"phase me out\". This was a confusing way of putting it because they told me that was my last day, not to come in next week, but they would pay me for two more weeks of work in addition to what I'm owed for hours worked in January. He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else. Our HR person chimes in to say that if i want to come in for a lunch to \"honor me\" they can arrange for that. The ceo\/owner tells me that I probably have a lot of questions, but he says he doesn't want me to ask any of them now and that I can call\/email him later with any questions or concerns that I may have. The whole thing felt very weird to me, but I was also very emotional and visibly upset.\n\nThis whole thing has me shocked and extremely scared. Even if I find another job right away, I will not qualify for FMLA once our baby arrives and it seems most places have a 1 year policy before maternity leave kicks in anyways. At this point I'm trying to figure out what my legal rights are. I'm in Oregon, so I know I'm in an \"at will\" state or whatever it's called. Does anyone have any advice on whether or not there's enough info here to pursue anything against my previous employer? I've filed for unemployment, and I'm actively searching for jobs but there's not much available in my field in my city at the moment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The [Pregnancy Discrimination Act](http:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/laws\/statutes\/pregnancy.cfm) makes it illegal for any employer in the U.S. with 15 or more workers to treat employees unfairly because they are pregnant. That means:\n\nYour boss can’t fire you or cut your hours when she finds out that you’re pregnant—you have the right to keep working as long as you can still do your job. You also have the right to be free from harassment at work because you are pregnant.\n\nYou cannot be asked about your pregnancy or plans to have children in a job interview.\n\nYour employer can’t treat you differently from other workers just because you are pregnant. The Supreme Court just decided a case where they clarified what this means. The Court said that employers may not put a “significant burden” on pregnant employees. How do you know what’s a significant burden? Start looking around at how your employer treats other non-pregnant employees who have needed an accommodation at work. For example, does your employer have a policy of giving light duty only to those with on-the-job injuries? Or did they have no problem helping out folks with non-pregnancy related disabilities, but sent all the pregnant women out onto unpaid leave? If so, this could be evidence of pregnancy discrimination. Since we are still waiting for further clarification of how this standard works, it’s best to collect all the evidence you can (policies, employee handbooks or manuals, digging around to find out how others have been treated) and to discuss your particular situation with an attorney.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/babygate.abetterbalance.org\/oregon\/ END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Ex-employer paid my vacation time out at $12\/hour instead of $17 because they \"didn't feel comfortable\"\nT: GOOD\nB: I'm going to try and make this as simple as possible. I live in Louisiana, and I was a retail department manager for the same company for 2 years. In the second year, I never used my vacation time and had accrued almost 30 hours. In June of 2019 I announced that I was going to drop down in my position to pursue my own personal business, but wasn't sure if I was going to drop down to a part time sales associate or a full time team lead. I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12\/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9\/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended. Well, a couple of months go by and I keep following up with my physical therapist (who I see 2x a week), and they say my policy is still active. So I keep going. I realize I wasn't paid out my vacation time, so I get back in touch with the district manager who starts looking into the issue. Turns out, I was paying for my insurance out of my vacation time for a few months, so it was never paid out in cash. She talks to the benefits department and determines they will pay me out that week. Here's the kicker, the REGIONAL manager says he doesn't feel comfortable paying me out at my $17\/hour rate that I worked for 2 years because it was apparently changed in the system by my boss to $12\/hour, even though I have never worked at the company for $12\/hour. I have a full email conversation of the benefits department saying I needed to be paid out at my old rate, and them saying they \"aren't comfortable\". I said screw it, I don't think thats legal and theres no HR department for the company, but I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. Fast forward to now, I got a call from my psychologist saying the insurance was terminated July 28th, and I owe them $400. I also get a call from my physical therapist for the same reason, saying I owe them $1800. I have proof from my ADP (payroll company) log in, that I had paid for the insurance out of my vacation time through November. But it doesn't matter since it was reported as cancelled in July.\n\nThe major question is, what can I do?

{"prompt":" Q: How to dispose of firearms owned by felon family member currently in prison? [Georgia]\nT: GOOD\nB: Hello. Bit of a back story here but \n\nA few years ago, my dad was arrested for some pretty serious crimes and was bailed out a few days after. As I was a minor then, I was taken by CPS and sent to live with my mom and stepdad. During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. \n\nHe took all of his stuff and any thing I didn’t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn’t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)\n\nHis dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he’d stop paying it. That’s fine with me as I have no contact with my dad and have been meaning to cut my name off his stuff but hey, life happens. I decided recently that I’d go through it and get my stuff and just let the storage place auction the rest. Opened it up after not seeing it in years, and there’s two firearms. \n\nThere’s no telling if they’re registered (I’m pretty sure he bought them off Craigslist or something similar) or even legal in any capacity. One is a pistol and another is some kind of automatic rifle. Not sure. Don’t know much about guns. I didn’t touch them or the bullet cartridges with them. My sister was with me and touched them to see if they were real. \n\nI closed it, locked it, and called my stepdad to ask what to do. He told me to tell the people that own the units, my mom says go to police since my dad is technically a felon (he’s still in prison for another decade plus) and my sister (paranoid ex drug addict) says we should just leave them and I need to forget my stuff in there because “the cops will make it look like we own them illegally” (taking that with a grain of salt)\n\nSo. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what would happen if the people go to auction it and see the guns like fucking loaded and if they’ll contact me or what. But I am completely unsure of what to do here. Any advice is seriously appreciated. For what it matters I’m currently 19 and my sister is 21. \n\nEdit: as far as selling\/keeping the guns, I’m not interested in keeping them and know absolutely nothing about gun safety and\/or transactions. \n\nAlso think I should mention that the pistol has a homemade silencer on it. It’s one of those giant flashlights hollowed out. I remember him making it when we lived together but I thought he got rid of everything after being arrested.\n\nAs far as I know, they were never used in the commission of a crime. He’s ex-military and we lived in the countryside so there was always guns in the house. His felony charges are sex offender related\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is no registration in Georgia for firearms. There is federal registration for NFA items (basically silencers, machine guns and sawn off rifles and shotguns). While it it technically possible you have an actual \"automatic rife\" its far more likely to be a semi-auto rifle and thus does not need registration.\n\nNAL, but personally I'd just call the police on the non emergency line and tell them you found some firearms in a storage unit.

Do not touch them, do not let the storage unit go to auction. Immediately contact the police non-emergency line and explain you need to meet an officer at the storage place and that you have most likely found illegal items owned by your felon father who is currently in prison. Meet them promptly and explain (be kind and courteous) that the items are emphatically NOT yours and that they are your fathers and were unaware of them until now. Let them examine and remove the items. Regardless of whether they search the rest for the storage locker or not, ask one of the officers for a card and ask them if you can contact them if you find anything else that might be illegal.

{"prompt":" Q: How to dispose of firearms owned by felon family member currently in prison? [Georgia]\nT: BAD\nB: Hello. Bit of a back story here but \n\nA few years ago, my dad was arrested for some pretty serious crimes and was bailed out a few days after. As I was a minor then, I was taken by CPS and sent to live with my mom and stepdad. During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. \n\nHe took all of his stuff and any thing I didn’t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn’t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)\n\nHis dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he’d stop paying it. That’s fine with me as I have no contact with my dad and have been meaning to cut my name off his stuff but hey, life happens. I decided recently that I’d go through it and get my stuff and just let the storage place auction the rest. Opened it up after not seeing it in years, and there’s two firearms. \n\nThere’s no telling if they’re registered (I’m pretty sure he bought them off Craigslist or something similar) or even legal in any capacity. One is a pistol and another is some kind of automatic rifle. Not sure. Don’t know much about guns. I didn’t touch them or the bullet cartridges with them. My sister was with me and touched them to see if they were real. \n\nI closed it, locked it, and called my stepdad to ask what to do. He told me to tell the people that own the units, my mom says go to police since my dad is technically a felon (he’s still in prison for another decade plus) and my sister (paranoid ex drug addict) says we should just leave them and I need to forget my stuff in there because “the cops will make it look like we own them illegally” (taking that with a grain of salt)\n\nSo. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what would happen if the people go to auction it and see the guns like fucking loaded and if they’ll contact me or what. But I am completely unsure of what to do here. Any advice is seriously appreciated. For what it matters I’m currently 19 and my sister is 21. \n\nEdit: as far as selling\/keeping the guns, I’m not interested in keeping them and know absolutely nothing about gun safety and\/or transactions. \n\nAlso think I should mention that the pistol has a homemade silencer on it.

He’s ex-military and we lived in the countryside so there was always guns in the house. His felony charges are sex offender related\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What I recommend, if you can, is to see what the manufacturer of the firearms is on the weapons. Usually, the manufacturer will have a serial number look up on their website and you can see there if the weapons have been obtained illegally.\n\nOf course, going through the local police department is much easier in terms of having access to larger databases.

Misdiagnoses happen all the time that, while incorrect, are not unreasonable. Did they misinterpret the tests? Were there other tests that they should have done? Etc. You generally prove this through expert evidence.\n\nThe other issue is what injuries they caused you. You mention the ER debt, the OBGYN, and the surgery. Even if the ER doctor(s) did misdiagnose her, they may not have caused her to have to see an OBGYN and have surgery. That may very well have happened anyway (i.e. had the first ER doctor picked up on the ectopic pregnancy, she still may have incurred those OBGYN\/surgery costs). You may be able to prove that had the first doctor caught it, you could have taken medication to end the pregnancy rather than requiring surgery, but this option may not have been available in your case (in other words, she still may have required surgery). In short, you aren't going to get money for health care costs that you would have incurred anyway to treat the ectopic pregnancy. However, if you are able to argue that the first ER doctor was unreasonable in failing to diagnose her condition, you may be able to recover the cost of the second ER visit (because it would have been unnecessary had the first doctor properly identified her condition). But that all hinges on the doctors being unreasonable and not just mistaken.\n\nYou aren't entitled to compensation for the \"almost fatal fallout\".

Until an expert who knows where to look and what to look for has had a chance to clear the building, there is still a chance the snake is still in there.\n\nHowever, if there are at least two people there together, then you can still come in and do your job - so long as it doesn't involve blindly reaching into dark spaces.

The nature of my job means I can do most of it from either the office or at home with the proviso that I need to be able to physically come in if there is a critical user issue that needs to be resolved urgently. Mostly I work in the office on weekdays, at home\/on call on weekends on a rolling shift system with one other guy.\n\nYesterday afternoon I was in the office when another employee on my floor saw a snake in the male toilet\/change rooms. We are on the ground floor and it is summer here so I have no reason to disbelieve this.

The majority of snake strikes are caused by either people stumbling into them or people trying to mess with a snake they know about already. \n\nIf you make plenty of noise, say by stomping around when you go into the office and playing music any snake is going to leave.

{"prompt":" Q: My employer deducted pension contributions from my paycheck, but never remitted them to the state, causing my account to expire and loss of privileges.

I am not necessarily looking for answers about the ins and outs of the state pension system, but more for what legal liability my employer might have for the ramifications this is causing.  \n\nI am public school teacher in NJ.  I had 5 years of service before I started with my former school in early 2017. They took 15 months to complete the intrafund transfer with much pestering from me (already ridiculous.)  Inactive pension accounts expire after two years.  Right before this time period was up (June 2018) the transfer went through.  I received certification from the state that the transfer was completed with a date of March 2017 (so I was only actually inactive for 8 months) and that my deductions and 15 months of back deductions would begin in June 2018.  From that date on, the deductions were coming out of each paycheck, in the correct amounts, under line items clearly denoting pension contribution and back pension contribution. \n\nI left that school this past June and took a job at in a different district for September.  At that point, I thought my biggest issue was waiting for another transfer and making sure I was putting money aside for the 2 remaining back payments, plus the back payments i would have to make after the transfer went through.  In October, the payroll department alerted me to the fact that they were having difficulty because they couldn't find an account in my name.  It seems that even though I was making these contributions, the state wasn't receiving them.  My account expired.  The state most likely sent a notice to a previous address.  I have had to enroll in new account.

My mother informed the travel agent she wanted to spend no more than between $6,000-$10,000 total for the trip. My Mother's friend agreed she didn't want to spend more than $5,000 for her portion. My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent. My mother was told the only expenses she would owe for their stays would be cleaning fees and that she would cover the security deposits. All other costs of the trip were to be equally split between my mother and her friend. \n\nAfter reviewing my Mother's accounts over Christmas, I realized a third-party company, on behalf of a travel agent my mother used, has charged my mother more than $50,000 total between her credit card and checking account beginning from before her trip, right up until the end of December. The travel agent is unable to provide invoices for the majority of the $50,000 charged to this third-party company. I was informed that because my mother’s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother’s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. \n\nThe travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. \n\nThe travel agent gained access to my mother’s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. \n\nThe travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.\n\nThe travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker\/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother’s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. \n\nI have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  \n\nMy main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? \n\nApologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. \n\nTL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances.

I was informed that because my mother’s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother’s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. \n\nThe travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. \n\nThe travel agent gained access to my mother’s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. \n\nThe travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.\n\nThe travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker\/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother’s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. \n\nI have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  \n\nMy main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? \n\nApologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. \n\nTL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances.

{"prompt":" Q: Mother taken advantage of by travel agent for $50,000 (MN\/FL)\nT: BAD\nB: In September of 2019, my mother and an old friend  she recently reconnected with who both live in Minnesota traveled to Spain and France for two weeks.

My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent.

{"prompt":" Q: Boyfriend's ankle monitor breaks or malfunctions so often. His new job is in jeopardy. [MA]\nT: GOOD\nB: My boyfriend has a GPS ankle monitor and a midnight-5AM curfew. He's been doing everything right but the thing breaks or stops working roughly every 2 weeks. We keep getting calls from his PO that he has to visit the nearest court asap for a replacement. He's on his third monitor in less than a month. He just started a new job and we're worried how much this is really affecting his life. He keeps getting pulled out of work, or we're woken up at 4 am by frantic phone calls.\n\nMy general question is, is there a period of good behavior he can show to a judge that may one day get it removed, or are bail conditions set in stone until the case is over? More specifically, is this normal to have so much issues with an ankle monitor?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If your boyfriend is on bail and the ankle monitor is a condition of his bail he should bend over backward to do whatever his PO tells him. \n\nI can’t say why the ankle monitors he’s using are so prone to malfunction or breaking, but technology is prone to wear and tear as just about anything is. It sounds like his PO is working with him to keep him within the conditions of his bail or probation by arranging for it to be replaced ASAP. \n\nI would gather also that there is possibly something interfering with the signal itself the device is sending or receiving. Do you also have trouble using a cell phone from inside the house, or are you all using a blanket with metal or wiring in it? \n\nGPS signals are very weak and be blocked by just roofs or walls. Just something to consider. END"}

Tell the PO that you believe the basement may be interfering with the GPS signal. Ask them if they can provide a base station that can be hooked up to the internet or boost the signal.\n\nJust from perusing google this is not an uncommon problem, these ankle monitors malfunctioning or not being able to send a signal, or in worse cases, reporting that the trackee is elsewhere than they should be.\n\nAs others have said, definitely talk with your lawyer if you have one and explain the situation you are having. Talk with the PO as well, and if you know the name of the company who does the actual monitoring (I'm almost positive they've probably outsourced this), call them up and explain the problem you're having and see if you have any recourse as well.\n\nThe worst possible thing you can do is \"wait and see\" in this case. Be proactive. Answer every call from your PO. Change your sleeping area if possible to allow for better signal. If this ends up in front of a judge and you haven't been prompt or diligent about reporting issues or switching out of equipment, it will reflect badly on you.\n\nSo yeah, talk to PO, talk to your lawyer who handled or is handling your case and make them both aware of the difficulties you're having. Depending on the charges and conditions of your probation, they may try to change the conditions of your bail to account for the difficulties, but if not, this will probably be one of them \"grin and bear it\" moments in life.

{"prompt":" Q: 70 year old Dad wants me (M 37) to take guardianship of his newborn\nT: BAD\nB: Throwaway account. Backstory: I'm 37 and recently married with no kids but my wife and I would like to start a family  soon.\n\nMy Dad (70) and Stepmom (55) just had a child (using in-vitro). It was a surprise to the rest of the family but clearly an intentional decision on their part.\n\nShe doesn't have any other family and my dad doesn't have any siblings. My brother (35) and I are his only family.   He keeps trying to tell me that I need to \"step up\" for the family and take guardianship of my new half-sister. But this seems like a pretty big decision given how old they both are.\n\nI love my father very much but he is not in great health and it's unlikely he will live until 88 when the child is of legal age. My stepmom is in better health but does not have great employment prospects so I'm worried that even if she lives, there wont be enough money.\n\nWhat exactly does guardianship entail legally and what can I do to protect myself before responding. They live in MD. We live in DC. I'm worried that this is pretty big ask to make to my wife at the start of our marriage. I haven't agreed to anything so welcome any and all advice and follow up questions.\n\nUpdate (for clarity): He's asked to take \"guardianship\" only if something happens to both of them, so not while they're both alive. But given their advanced age this feels like a possible scenario before the child turns 18.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I was unaware that they were religious terms, but in some places The terms godmother\/father and guardian  serve the same purpose.

{"prompt":" Q: [Michigan] Landlord apparently did not renew the rental license for the property we rent.\nT: BAD\nB: Hello!

As my title says, our assumption is that the landlord did not renew his rental license when it last expired. My SO is the one officially renting from him for the past 6 years, me being here for the past 4-ish. Last fall the landlord had mentioned wanting to sell the house and asked if he could put a for sale sign out, but he never did. \n\nMy question is whether we should contact the landlord first and see what he has to say or should we call the rental division first?

{"prompt":" Q: Girl has been cyberbullying\/harassing me for over a month. IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)\nT: GOOD\nB: Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!\n\nIt's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health\/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health\/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health\/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. \n\nEverything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest. At that point, she had been posting on it for a week before I found out about it.\n\n It was a fake account, but I instantly knew it was her (typing and word style, emoji usage, similarities between her real account and the fake account, and she admitted in one of the posts that she did the same thing over a year ago). \n\nIt became clear to me that this girl is not stable and I wanted to protect my safety, so I filed a police report for harassment. The police are currently investigating, although the investigator said, \"we probably can't do much because it's on social media and hard to prove it's her\", but I have so many screenshots that link her to the profile, but I'm afraid I won't get very far with the local police with this.\n\nShe does not live in my same city anymore, but she's just a few hours away. This account is seriously causing me some major emotional distress. I have reported it over and over to IG and have had trusted friends report it as well, but because of COVID-19, IG is saying they don't have enough people on staff to review the profile. \n\nBut then, I woke up this morning to the girl now posting my work information on the fake profile. My work email, my work phone number, and saying \"for a good time to call me\" and I can't get IG to do anything about this. I have a really good job and I do not want her compromising it.

{"prompt":" Q: Girl has been cyberbullying\/harassing me for over a month. IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)\nT: GOOD\nB: Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!\n\nIt's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health\/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health\/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health\/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. \n\nEverything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest. At that point, she had been posting on it for a week before I found out about it.\n\n It was a fake account, but I instantly knew it was her (typing and word style, emoji usage, similarities between her real account and the fake account, and she admitted in one of the posts that she did the same thing over a year ago). \n\nIt became clear to me that this girl is not stable and I wanted to protect my safety, so I filed a police report for harassment. The police are currently investigating, although the investigator said, \"we probably can't do much because it's on social media and hard to prove it's her\", but I have so many screenshots that link her to the profile, but I'm afraid I won't get very far with the local police with this.\n\nShe does not live in my same city anymore, but she's just a few hours away. This account is seriously causing me some major emotional distress. I have reported it over and over to IG and have had trusted friends report it as well, but because of COVID-19, IG is saying they don't have enough people on staff to review the profile. \n\nBut then, I woke up this morning to the girl now posting my work information on the fake profile. My work email, my work phone number, and saying \"for a good time to call me\" and I can't get IG to do anything about this. I have a really good job and I do not want her compromising it. She is still currently posting as I type. She has over 100 posts about me now, most including my personal information and slanderous comments. \n\nWhat can I do? Is there any way to get ahold of IG, and could they be liable for emotional distress?  I'm sure I have a case against her as well, but I do know she doesn't have very much money - might not be worth it or could it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I recently searched an old contact's instagram on Google. Their instagram was actually private so I couldnt see anything. However, there was some bypassing site that displayed all the person's private posts and you could read all the comments too. This was being displayed on a 3rd website, not on IG, but I could tell it was of the person's actual pictures and comments because I know the person pretty well. So even if your social media accounts are private, there are 3rd party websites displaying all their info, and they show up as one of the top searches on Goigle - very easy to find. END"}

Also, they specialize in family law and am not sure if this in their realm of expertise.\n\nThere are two categories of questions here. \n\nThe first is do you have a case, do you have losses to win in that case, and do you have any chance at recovery of those losses.  It would be hard to answer that from here.  \n\nAs u\/Selphis points out, that depends some on what interfering with your job means.  But it also looks at the fundamental defamation question - did she say things that she knew to be untrue, or did she say opinions and things she believed to be true when she said them.  \n\nIn general, in these kinds of statements, there would be much room for opinion or conclusions she reached even those they happened to be wrong.  A case might depend on *establishing with evidence* that she maliciously lied and not just that she was mistaken.  \n\nThe other question, and perhaps the even more likely reason that it would be unwise to sue here, is the impact that doing so might have on your custody case and on your ongoing coparenting arrangement (remember that very nearly *all* parents end up coparenting to some extent).  It's *likely* there isn't as much to gain here as there may be to lose, and your current attorney is the one to begin answering that question. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: My parents threw out all of my belongings while I was travelling - BC, Canada\nT: BAD\nB: So, I just got home to Canada after being away for 7 months in Australia to find out my mother and stepdad donated all of my clothes and pretty much everything I own to the salvation army\/threw in garbage. I really need advice so if someone could please read my story I would really appreciate it.\n\nI live in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\nI needed to put my items in storage when I was planning on travelling Australia, so I asked my mom and stepdad to help me move out of my apartment and store my items and they offered to help me if I paid them something like $100 for the gas, I agreed (stepdad has a work truck). \nI had packed about half of everything and they came over and helped me pack the rest(along with my friends), I put all of my clothes into garbage bags (about 8-10 bags), we moved all my necessities (including mattress, duvet, duvet cover, desk, bed frame, everything I owned) into the work truck and I told them to just put all my stuff under their house in the basement. \n\nI was originally going to donate some bags of clothes but I didn't have enough time to sort through them so we donated some furniture (my couches) to the salvation army, they wouldn't accept one of them so my stepdad said he would go to the dump and throw it out. I told them I'd deal with everything else when I get back in a year or so (they have a lot of storage space).\n\n\n**Fast forward**: I had to come home early due to covid, so after about 30 hours of travel I arrive back in Canada to my parents house. I went under the house because I wanted to wear a big comfy sweater that I missed (I only brought a suitcase of summer clothes to Australia because I knew it would be much warmer there). I go under the house and can't find any bags of clothing... I ask my mom where she put them and she said \"I'm not sure, whatever isn't there was donated\". WHAT?? They never said they were going to donate anything, as I asked them to keep all the boxes and bags. I asked further and she said that my roommate told them they could be donated, I immediately messaged him and he said that he heard them joking about just donating the items when I left, and he said he chimed in and said that he himself got rid of all of his stuff and joked around with them. I told her that excuse was bullshit and they could have had any ANY type of communication with me and I would told them to NOT get rid of the items... \n\nMy mom then said that some of the boxes were ripped and the bags had holes in them so she got rid of them. I continued to search and couldn't find much of anything. They got rid of my duvet, mattress, both of my memory foams pillows, drawing books with all my drawing supplies, VR headset, Samsung galaxy s8+ (including photos and memories that I did NOT upload), 500$ headphones, Google nexus, iPod, Nintendo 3ds, stereo system, they were ALL GONE along with all my clothes. \n\nThey would not have sold my items (they aren't intelligent enough to figure out prices and sell them). So they just threw out or donated them because they didn't want to deal with them. What they DID keep was reorganized into boxes and they labelled themselves.

I am in 14 day isolation so I haven't been talking with my mother. I know my stepdad will try and shove it back in my face by saying \"oh you left us with too much shit!\" But they didn't say ONE word to me that they didn't want to deal with it.\n\n I am a grown 25 year old man and they treat me and my belongings like I'm a child. Do I tell them to repay me for all of the items or talk to a lawyer about this? I am so nervous about the talk tomorrow - My step dad is quite manipulative and gets rid of things that clog up space for him, and my mom is a push over and gets stressed at the smallest things and is very emotionally immature so tomorrow is going to be very difficult. \n\nI don't have any intention of talking to my parents ever again after this. I trusted them and they completely betrayed that trust. All it would have taken is a phone call and I could have gotten someone to pick up my stuff or hired a moving company to put it in a storage locker. I feel empty and like I have nothing now.

{"prompt":" Q: Trade Show Cancelled due to Coronavirus but still being Charged :(\nT: BAD\nB: I had a trade show booked for June and have just been told it's been 'postponed' but the postponed date is actually the same date as it would have been held in 2021 as it's a yearly show. They haven't said this year has been 'cancelled' probably because the contract would then be void. This means they will have the money I've paid already for an extra year and are holding me to keep the stand I've booked. Obviously it's a testing time for most businesses and I don't even know if my business will survive so I could do with the money and not having to worry that I need to pay the remainder. Can anyone offer any advice? Thanks\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What does your contract say about the event being cancelled\/delayed or occuring in a specific time frame? END"}

Today she informed us that a parcel is going to be delivered to our house for another individual, which she's to hold onto until she receives further instructions.\n\nMy understanding is that we should report the situation to the federal authorities, but I'm also concerned whether there are any legal repercussions for my wife, her sisters, and I, regarding being accessories to the crime or what have you due to having been aware of it for some time and not having reported it sooner.

Sometimes they'll call it a \"cashier's check\", a \"certified check\", or a \"verified check\".\n\n&gt;You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account is not the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law.\n\n&gt;For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins.\n\n&gt;Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Car towed out of my own driveway\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in San Jose, California. This morning I went out to my driveway to find that my car had gotten towed out of the driveway. I just moved into a townhouse that is part of a HOA. When I moved in I read over the the HOA’s bylaws regarding parking. My house is a different situation because it has a driveway. All the other homes go straight from the driveway to the street. All of the curbs (except for flat spot in front of garages) are painted red for fire lanes. The HOA bylaws have two rules: “no parking on red curbs for more than 20 minutes” and “no parking on curbs in front of garage. \nMy home is the only one in about 25 or so homes that has a driveway between the garage and the curb. When I moved in, the leasing company said I could park in my own driveway. About two days after moving in, I got a violation sticker on my car when It was parked in the driveway.

You can always call lawyers and see if they're interested in suing the HOA.  In that suit you stand to gain the cost of the tow.  It's not necessarily clear that is worthwhile, and likely could proceed in small claims court. \n\nWhat we don't know is if you have a case.  You've interpreted the association rules.  You might start with asking the association to explain to you the rule they believe you're violating and how it applies to your circumstance.  \n\n&gt;I got a violation sticker on my car when It was parked in the driveway.\n\nThis would have been the right time to start that conversation.  \n\n&gt;When I find it I’m not sure if I should pay and get my car back first or talk to the HOA and leave my car there.\n\nPay to retrieve your car.  Stop the losses of accumulating storage fees.  Then pursue the HOA for those costs if appropriate. END"}

It is illegal, however, to retaliate against an employee who has disclosed that information. I would talk to your local department of labor to see what they have to say about the situation, and also possibly an attorney. If you do speak with an attorney, it would be beneficial to start considering the possibility that it may be more cost effective to just find another job, since it sounds like you haven't actually suffered any losses yet.\n\nAlso, it may be wise to start writing down all transactions between you and management.

We're 26-30 years old. About 9 months ago, their family friend Roommate (20M) moved in. We all pay rent, utilities, etc. About 4 months ago, Roommate asked if his girlfriend of two years could move in. Brothers agreed and added $150 to Roommate's rent so that the cost could be split between Roommate and Girlfriend.\n\nProblems begin immediately. Girlfriend is an all around bad roommate. She has no job or savings so Roommate pays the full portion for rent and for food. They both smoke marijuana excessively, but Roommate has a medical marijuana card and works at a smoke shop so we leave it alone. (We don't smoke) Girlfriend never got a key to the house so she just leaves it unlocked while we're all at work. She steals food. She left the backyard after open and let the dog out. Etc.\n\nRoommate and Girlfriend break up because he caught her sending nudes to multiple people. She said it was for money. He said there were no transactions. He makes up excuses about her moving out for a few weeks but she finally leaves.\n\nThis brings us to Sunday. We're eating with a mutual friend and find out that Girlfriend is 16. We're all horrified and angry at roommate for dating a minor and not telling us while she was in the house.\n\nWhen we get home that day, we find her in the house. Alone. No idea how she got in.\n\nSo here come the questions. She's still here because Roommate is refusing to make her leave no matter what the brothers say. How do we get her to leave? Does she have any tenants rights if there is no written lease and she never paid for anything?\n\nRoommate is saying she should be allowed to stay because he already paid her part of the rent. He thinks she should stay for a month or two more. She hides from us.\n\nBrothers are considering calling the police to remove her, but I'm worried they could be held liable for her actions since they happened in the house.

I don't know how this would affect him.\n\nA friend said calling CPS might help? She didn't have a poor family situation before moving in. She lived with her parents 2 hours away.\n\nOlder brother is considering forcibly taking her to her parents house on Saturday while Roommate is at work. I think that could end poorly.\n\nHow can we resolve this as safely and legally as possible?\nLocation is Mesa, AZ.\n\nEdit: Moved city to the bottom of the post.\n\nUpdate: We threatened to call the police and she left to go to a friend's house until her parents pick her up. As landlords, the brothers told Roommate that girlfriend is not allowed back in the house. As friends, we're trying to get him to cut all contact with her since the relationship is clearly inappropriate. Whether or not he continues living here is up to the brothers. \n\nI appreciate everyone's advice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'd argue it would probably be best to contact CPS first.

{"prompt":" Q: Our roommate's girlfriend is underage. We want her out of the house ASAP.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi all, this is a bit complex so I'll try to simplify as much as possible.\n\nI live with my boyfriend and his older brother in a home they own together. We're 26-30 years old. About 9 months ago, their family friend Roommate (20M) moved in. We all pay rent, utilities, etc. About 4 months ago, Roommate asked if his girlfriend of two years could move in. Brothers agreed and added $150 to Roommate's rent so that the cost could be split between Roommate and Girlfriend.\n\nProblems begin immediately. Girlfriend is an all around bad roommate. She has no job or savings so Roommate pays the full portion for rent and for food. They both smoke marijuana excessively, but Roommate has a medical marijuana card and works at a smoke shop so we leave it alone. (We don't smoke) Girlfriend never got a key to the house so she just leaves it unlocked while we're all at work. She steals food. She left the backyard after open and let the dog out. Etc.\n\nRoommate and Girlfriend break up because he caught her sending nudes to multiple people. She said it was for money. He said there were no transactions. He makes up excuses about her moving out for a few weeks but she finally leaves.\n\nThis brings us to Sunday. We're eating with a mutual friend and find out that Girlfriend is 16. We're all horrified and angry at roommate for dating a minor and not telling us while she was in the house.\n\nWhen we get home that day, we find her in the house. Alone. No idea how she got in.\n\nSo here come the questions. She's still here because Roommate is refusing to make her leave no matter what the brothers say. How do we get her to leave? Does she have any tenants rights if there is no written lease and she never paid for anything?\n\nRoommate is saying she should be allowed to stay because he already paid her part of the rent. He thinks she should stay for a month or two more. She hides from us.\n\nBrothers are considering calling the police to remove her, but I'm worried they could be held liable for her actions since they happened in the house. Underage drug use, distributing child pornography, and statutory rape come to mind. \n\nRoommate is on probation, but I don't know for what. I don't know how this would affect him.\n\nA friend said calling CPS might help? She didn't have a poor family situation before moving in.

Your roommate has been committing statutory rape, the girl has been creating and distributing child pornography.\n\nEdit: as another comment pointed out, go to CPS first, the girls actions may be as a result of her home life END"}
