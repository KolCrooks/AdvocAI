The cost to file (which is also recoverable if ruled in your favor) would be more if not double your initial damages. So you'd risk an afternoon plus an additional $120 or however much it costs in Illinois.\n\nNonlegal\/realistic options are to look into reporting them to whatever agency would oversee their license, reporting them to the BBB, leaving reviews via google or all other sites they are listed. If you payed via CC then call up the number to dispute the charge made(this generally will cost them a one-time fee to respond to the disputed charge.) If possible get the police report\/incident report of the situation to attach to the dispute if that would help your case. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Tow truck company stole our rental car\nT: GOOD\nB: Location: Nyc\n\nThis is a long and complicated story so i bolded the important parts .\n\nMe and my boyfriend's car was in the shop so we got a rental car for a week, as we both need a car to work and make money. We had no problems with the car and we were set to return it Friday morning. Thursday night we parked the car a few blocks from our house . Our neighborhood has basically no parking so we had to park near a fire hydrant about 6 feet away **which is illegal but does not warrant a tow only a ticket** from the city. It was extremely late and we were exhausted so we just said fuck it, we'll pay the ticket if it comes to that. We were not parked in a tow zone, in front of a driveway, none of that.\n\nThe next morning the car was gone. I called the nearest precinct and they said the NYPD did not tow it but they have a citywide database so they found out who towed it - A private towing company, lets call them Terrible Towing Company (TTC). I called TTC and they told me  **I could not come get the car not even my personal belongings inside it ,** and that only the rental company could come get it as they owned the car not me.  **TTC also told me that the rental company had called it in to be towed,** which did not make sense because I had just spoken to the rental company, letting them know I was on my way to return the car, and they said okay no problem.\n\nThis is where it gets weird. I called the rental company and let them know what had happened. They said **they did not call it in to be towed** . I told them okay I will file a complaint at the precinct and try my best to get the car back on Monday (my actual car got out the shop on Monday and the tow company is very far away so I couldn't use regular public transportation).\n\nFast forward to Monday: Me and my boyfriend go to the precinct. They tell us we can't file a regular criminal complaint because it's technically not larceny. We have to file a complaint with the DCA or BBB and bring it to small claims court.  Mind you the cop also says \"This happens a lot in this neighborhood...Hating neighbors call the cops on each other all the time for petty things\" ... (Me and my bf just moved over here).\n\nThen we drove to the tow yard. Nobody was there and gates are closed so can't see inside. I called the tow company, and the guy tells me \"**The bank took the car to Long Island. It got repossessed.** You can't get it or get your things from inside, only the rental company can do that.\" I try to press him and tell him that he lied to me, the rental company did not call the car to be towed, and it did not get repossessed. He tells me talk to the rental company, not his problem. I say where did the bank take the car. He says talk to the rental company. Etc...\n\nSo. I call the rental company. They tell me the tow company is lying, it's impossible that the car got repossessed, etc., and furthermore the rental company would know if the bank took it and nobody notified them.\n\nHERE'S THE THING. The rental company charges per day. I am racking up $500 and counting in extra rental fees that I am not financially prepared for, not to mention possible tow fees that they might try to hit me with. How can I resolve this legally? Is there a way I can sue the tow truck company in small claims court and have them pay the cost of my rental fees? Can I even put a larger lawsuit together from other people who have been victim to their illegal towing?\n\nAlso note: The reviews of the towing company is hilarious. All one star, saying \"I had to call the police to get my car back\" and \"They are crooks, they hold people's car for ransom\" etc. They have been doing this for years.\n\nPLEASE HELP!!! Sorry for length of post.\n\nTL;DR: Tow truck company illegally towed my rental car off the street and is now claiming the bank repossessed it, even though the rental company says this is not true. Tow company is refusing to tell me where the car is.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Call the police while outside the tow yard, tell them they won't release the car you are renting. END"}

We live in Washington state.\n\nShe's a receptionist at a local family owned business, and works 10am to 5pm. Her boss leaves at 3pm and when she leaves, she turns off the A\/C. They've always had issues with heating and cooling there because it is an old building, and it's pricey to keep the A\/C on. So, despite having employees and customers still in the building for 2-3 more hours, the boss turns off A\/C when she's all done.\n\nEven with A\/C, it's around 80 degrees in there.

A tiny, portable fan about the size of a bowling ball that doesn't work.\n\nToday it was 101 degrees, and 86 in the building when my mom left. She was nauseous due to the heat and felt fatigued and ill (we're assuming heat exhaustion).\n\nI feel like this is in a grey area of legality.

This is blowing up and I am truly overwhelmed and appreciative of all the advice and support I've gotten. It's nearly 4:00 in the morning here and I have not been able to sleep. It looks like it's going to be a very busy day for me. I called CPS last night and filed the report with them. I'm a little apprehensive about calling the cops as well. The reasons for my reluctance is that I don't want to further traumatize my daughter by having her see either her mother or autistic brother arrested. I am hoping CPS will take her away before seeing anything like that. I will be filing an ex parte before noon today to get emergency custody, hopefully I can get the wording right for the judge to grant me that. I do not have a lawyer to do this for me, as I just can't afford it. I'm an unpaid caregiver to my disabled mother who just gets room and board for my work with her. Though I am working through my doctor to get my veteran benefits going, so I can have some kind of income, as it is impossible for me to work given my mothers needs and medical issues.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" He is an adult and she is not, that is being a sexual predator.

{"prompt":" Q: Vet Malpractice advice\nT: GOOD\nB: I am on vacation and heartbroken. I brought my 6 year old long hair to a veterinarian office that boards animals. He is diabetic so I had to take him here while my other 2 cats remained at home. He was there for 2 days and they called me to tell me that he passed.\n\nI have the phone conversations recorded. They claim that they gave him his shots Sat night, Sunday Morning\/Night, and then today when they came in he was lethargic and they knew something was wrong. They checked his glucose level and it was 23. They claim they gave him IV and then shortly after he had a 5 second seizure, but then pepped up, and died shortly after.\n\nI asked \"what was his glucose levels the last 2 days?\". They responded with \"we never took his glucose levels\". I asked \"how much was he eating before this happened\". They responded with \"they were feeding him dry so they weren't sure how much he was eating\". They overdosed my cat on insulin and had no idea whether he needed it. I can't imagine a situation where a vet could knowingly give a cat insulin without knowing whether he was eating or what his levels were. He was young, healthy, and fine before this. You bring a cat to board at a vet because you expect them to treat their health professionally. I got no calls, no warnings. If they called me yesterday and said \"he hasn't been eating- his glucose levels are low so we don't feel comfortable dosing him\", I would have left vacation and came home for him. I would have had a relative pick him up and bring him home. I know how glucose levels float around with diabetic cats. I see his levels spike every time I bring him for a checkup or shots. I have never seen his levels go below 150. He always floated around 175-200 and sometimes at the vet that number would jump to 250 or more.\n\nI really can't fathom how this could have happened. Am I wrong or is this blatant malpractice? Anyone have any advice? I feel so guilty that I trusted this institution with my animal. If I never left he would still be alive. His main vet would never administer insulin without knowing his glucose levels. He also always advised that if I didn't see him to eat then I shouldn't administer insulin because his levels could drop. They a.) didn't monitor his eating b.) check his glucose levels till it was too late. These are the 2 biggest NO-NOs when it comes to a diabetic animal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also add that I live in New York and the reason we brought him here is because they call themselves a \" Veterinary Hospital Pet Resort and Spa\" and that my cat would have an entire 4'x10' room to himself where he would be cared for by vets. \n\nThanks for any help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all I am so so sorry.  This is horrible.  I would be have a combination of crippling sorrow and fury and I have a special fondness for long hair cats.

When I was away someone else did the monitoring and feeding.  \n\nI take it you provided the vet hospital with the appropriate records\/instructions about the health of the cat.  Yes the entire point of boarding at a vet is to have appropriate vet care and having glucose monitoring \n\nI would consider reporting this to the veterinary board.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.op.nysed.gov\/opd\/\n\nThere is precedent in NYS for suing and being awarded for mental suffering when it comes to a pet -- I refer you to Corso v Crawford Dog and Cat Hospital  415 N.Y.S.2d (182 N.Y.City Civ.Ct., 1979) \n\n[https:\/\/www.animallaw.info\/case\/corso-v-crawford-dog-and-cat-hospital-inc](https:\/\/www.animallaw.info\/case\/corso-v-crawford-dog-and-cat-hospital-inc)\n\nYou may be able to sue in small claims court.\n\nI am so sad for you.

This is my dream and I really want to include it in my book so I able to teach everyone how to fold papers to make it and not let the instruction lose in memories.\n\nThe book will sold on Amazon and of course there will be some profit for me, all these models too me years to design and a lot effort and work put into it and I hope to upgrade my laptop and so on to create more amazing contents, so some profit will definitely help, hope you understand.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Don't use \"Starship Troopers\" in any of your text, and don't use screencaps\/images from the movie  and you'll be fine.

{"prompt":" Q: [US-MO] My landlord withheld all of my security deposit for “untreatable odor.” This odor was a result of mold and mushrooms growing out of a wall that I notified him of months before the lease ended\nT: GOOD\nB: [US-MO] So back in March I stopped living in my apartment due to COVID and all my classes going remote.

So I cleaned it, and left.\n\nI came back in another 2 weeks to get some stuff and there were mushrooms growing out of my wall. The smell was not just in the bathroom but also the bedroom. I immediately called my landlord and he gave me a lecture about humidity in the apartment and that if I’m not living there or running the AC things can get wet. I told him I don’t care, and to get rid of the mushrooms. He said he’d get maintenance to take care of it.\n\nI come back in a month to move the rest of my things out. The mushrooms were STILL there. There was visible black mold coming out of the wall. I did my best to clean the rest of the apartment, cut the mushroom stems and tried to bleach where the black mold was growing.

Is there anything I can do about this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You can sue.\n\nThat's the normal dispute system. Go to small claims court in the county or city that you are in and sue for the amount of money. Missouri does allow the landlord to withhold from the security deposit, but only things that that you cause. So, if you take a hammer to the wall then you would be responsible. If you also never sweep off the back porch which causes the wood to rot under a pile of leaves then you would also be responsible. Normal wear and tear doesn't count against you.\n\nHe is going to claim that you didn't mothball the place when you left it which led to the damage. You point out that you told him about the damage before you left the first time. If you have pictures or video of before you left the first time *AND* when you came back to move your stuff out then that would be very strong.\n\nThe judge would then determine who should have to pay for the water damage, fungus, and mold. Small claims is pretty cheap, so even if you lose then you're not out a lot of money. The landlords in college towns often assume that college students aren't going to fight stuff like this, so sometimes getting the notification of a court date gets them to back off. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: An adult man (20's) has been giving\/selling vapes and marijuana to my 12 year old sister and her friends\nT: GOOD\nB: Location: USA, North Carolina\n\nMy half-sister has had difficulty dealing with not having her father around. We share the same mother. I'm 25, and I've been like a second mother to her since she was born. My mother and I have noticed that she's been running with a bad crowd and decided to catch her off-guard and take her computer while she was still logged on. We had already confiscated her phone and put her on restriction. \n\nI noticed that she had her Snapchat login information saved into the browser. Like any person trying to figure out why their smart, bright young sister was skipping homework assignments and getting into trouble, I logged in, changed the password to her Snapchat so I could open the app on my phone. Sorry, that might be confusing to some of you unfamiliar with the app. \n\nWe found vapes of various kinds in her room a few weeks ago. Mostly cheap $15 disposable ones. More than anything I wanted to get to the bottom of where she was getting these things from. To my horror, it wasn't long before I found messages from a guy named Bob. She messaged him asking if he could bring her some \"nic\"\n\nHe told her that he was broke and didn't have enough gas to get all the way to our house, but she reassured him that she would pay for his gas if he came by our house first. She gave him our address. He came by our house, picked up the $30 she stole from our wallets, went to a head shop to buy the vapes, and then brought them back to her. It's all in the messages. \n\nThis meant he was old enough to drive and was old enough to buy tobacco (21 in the US). It didn't take long for me to connect the dots between him and a conversation I had with my sister a few weeks ago about some guy that worked at a fast food chain restaurant. She said he was a creepy guy that talked to all of her friends, but primarily one named Anna (14). She brought it up in a way that made me think he was some teenager, but I was wrong. \n\nI immediately confronted her and she went into more detail about this creep. She confessed that she was afraid of him because he has a short temper, and her friend Anna was deeply involved with him. Apparently he picks Anna up in his van sometimes, and one of the times recently things went \"bad\" between them. Anna refused to tell my sister any more than that. Anna lives in our neighborhood, and my sister explained that part of the deal was that she gave Anna one of the vapes he dropped off. \n\nMy sister explained that since he's an alcoholic and works in fast food, he's broke and has a group of young girls and boys he threatens for these vapes so they get them any way possible. He'll take the vapes from them and give them to Anna and her younger sister because he has a crush on both of them and wants to control them. He also gives them marijuana. He has mentioned to these girls that he thinks age is just a number.\n\nI confronted him as soon as I saw those messages, and maybe I shouldn't have. I was so upset though. I called him a loser for getting gas money from a 12 year old girl. I told him never to contact her again. I plan on deleting that Snapchat profile anyways, but I'm keeping it as long as I need to for evidence. \n\nI plan on going to the authorities, but I realistically wanted to know what would happen. I have one of the vapes he gave her, the messages from his Snapchat profile to her, and I know where he works. \n\nMy sister agreed to answer any questions the police may have regarding him. I know when his shifts are, so I planned on waiting for him to drive in tomorrow so I could get his plate number. I don't know his last name. I feel so helpless. \n\nIf the authorities are no help, I want to go into the restaurant and speak with his manager when he's not there. I know they can't really do anything to him legally, but it might make me feel better knowing that they know what a creep he is. \n\nDo I need more to get the attention of police?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Call the police and report this.  They can get your sister's story, messages, and then get the video from the vape stores.    They will go after this loser.

{"prompt":" Q: My school lost an item irreplaceable to me while moving my belongings from my dorm over the summer without my consent. (Florida)\nT: GOOD\nB: After spring break, my school decided that classes would shift from in-person to online, and that students were to move out. Initially, my school informed us that we had until April 19th to retrieve our belongings from our dorms. I arranged plans to retrieve my belongings before this date, but on April 1st there was a state-order to stay in place, and students (myself included) were told that we would not be able to retrieve our belongings until at least May 1st. On April 17th, my school sent an email to students informing us that our belongings were being moved. This was troubling to me, because I knew that I had things in my dorm that were irreplaceable to me, especially a pillow that was made by my dad who died when I was 15. I emailed them the same day expressing that I would not like my belongings touched at all. They plainly ignored this, saying they need to move belongings, and informing me that I would be contacted later on as to where I could retrieve my items. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I’ve moved back into a new dorm, after having retrieved what I thought was all my belongings on May 4th, and I realize that my pillow made by my dad is missing. I email my school’s housing department, explaining my previous room and the details of my missing pillow. I did not receive a reply until 2 days ago, Friday, and only after pestering them several times that I had not even been acknowledged. I was informed that the housing department has not found my pillow in their storage areas or any other boxes labeled for my room, and that they will exhaust all search possibilities in another attempt tomorrow, Monday. \n\nNeedless to say I am enraged at the carelessness they’ve shown with misplacing my belonging, but what’s more I suspect that my pillow has been thrown away, as most mattress pads (including my own) were not returned and were thrown away. I would like to know if I have any options for finding compensation from my school if my priceless item was lost, and especially if it was disposed of without consultation or even notification.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am sorry.

{"prompt":" Q: Austin Tx car dealer scammed me. Never gave me title, then went out of business. I'm military; trying to register in Nevada. DTP suit pending, but can I get legal help fighting DMV issues?\nT: BAD\nB: *This post is a bit used-car heavy, but please see my specific legal questions near the bottom of the thread. \\[Cross-posted in* [r\/askcarsales](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askcarsales\/), r\/Austin and r\/DMV\\]\n\n*TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank\/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. Scroll to bolded text near the bottom for questions.*\n\n* Bought used car in Feb 2020. Dealership is in Austin, TX, but I'm not a Texas resident. (I'm military temporarily serving in Texas, but intend to register vehicle in Nevada.) Dealership didn't have title because they \"just got the car in, but title is coming and we'll send it to the Nevada DMV ASAP.\" I foolishly fell for it. My bank (USAA) paid them directly, and now I repay the loan monthly to USAA. I do have a bill of sale, and other related paperwork from the transaction (we-owe, odometer statement, etc,) ... just no title.\n* I kept pinging the dealership about title\/registration. They avoided me for a few weeks, saying \"we're working it,\" but eventually they just decide to ghost me. (I don't live in Austin ... Visiting in person wasn't an easy option.)\n* I call USAA for help. They won't clawback the loan to allow me to take the car back. (Besides, dealership isn't obligated to take car back anyway.) USAA's stance is: They gave the money to me, not the dealership (even though they LITERALLY gave the money directly to the dealership.) I'm making monthly payments to USAA on a car I don't have a title for, even while USAA sends me periodic letters harassing me because they don't have the title for the loan (as the lienholder.)\n* Months go by. The temp plates the dealership gave me are expired. (Luckily, COVID-19 has caused some cities to issue waivers for expired registration, so I'm safe for now. But once the waiver expires, I won't have registration, nor temp tags.) I can purchase one 30-day tag from the DMV, but once it expires, I'll still be without registration, and the rules only allow ONE purchase of a temp tag. (I can't buy them multiple times back-to-back.)\n* I got a lawyer and also filed a complaint with Texas DMV Dealership Enforcement division. Texas Attorney General was not interested in helping; deferred to DMV. BBB is worthless. Military lawyers don't work these issues.\n* DMV investigator says dealership was not on the level, with multiple people having the same issue. The dealership acquired cars, but didn't make good on the titles. (I don't know exactly what this means ... Maybe the dealership financed the cars from an auction but didn't pay the auction house they bought them from?) Whatever the reason, the dealership was selling cars they knew they couldn't deliver titles on.\n\n(FYI: The car itself is fine. Carfax is clean, it's not salvaged; I had the car inspected before purchase, and I've been driving it since Feb, even took a cross-country road trip with no problems. I have no problems with the car itself, other than I can't register it because I don't have title.)\n\n* DMV investigator tells me the dealership is going out of business. (I guess they're pulling out out now before more people sue.) They weren't responsive to me anyway ... but now this means I have no hope of getting the dealership to make things right.\n* Lawyer files suit for Deceptive Trade Practices. (I'm still waiting for this to play out, but with dealer going out of business, I'm not expecting much to result from this. Maybe I win a default judgement that I can't collect.)\n\nI go to DMV to research options.\n\n* I can't request \"duplicate title,\" because duplicate titles are for when the CURRENT owner needs a copy of the current title s\/he once had. (Since I never had the title in my name, I have no proof that I'm the current owner and can't request a duplicate.)\n* I research a \"bonded title,\" and learn that I could purchase a surety bond. This would allow me to get a bonded title, and register the car in Texas, but not Nevada. But, I also learn that in the event that someone else lays claim to the vehicle (say, the dealership, or the auction house that the dealer never paid,) then the bond will pay the previous claimant and I'd be required to repay the bondsman (while STILL replaying my USAA loan.) This would effectively make me financially liable for TWICE what I was expecting to pay for the car.\n* I complete a TX DMV form VTR-130 \"Notice of Determination for a Bonded Title,\" and the DMV annotates that there is no lien on the vehicle. I'm supposed to use this to purchase a surety bond, but I'm holding off for now, because I'm not sure I want to do this. Lawyer also advises me to hold off going this route in hopes other solutions arise.\n\nMy concern is that SOMEONE (either the auction house where the dealer got the car, or the dealer themselves) will claim to be the rightful owner, forcing me to repay the bond.\n\n* I was able to track down the previous owner, who says he traded in the vehicle to \"Covert Autogroup\" dealership in Dec 2019. Since I bought the car in Feb 2020, this leaves about two months where Covert must've sold the car to either the dealership or an auction. I've tried calling Covert twice ... I can't easily go there in person, and each time I call and ask for the finance\/title dept, I get transferred to a voicemail that is unanswered. (Even if I was to reach a human, I doubt they will help me anyway.)\n\nI assume there's a *reason* the dealer didn't give me a title, and I need to pinpoint who might claim ownership of the car. I think I need to find who the dealer purchased the car from, and somehow get proof that they no longer have an interest in the vehicle (or, at least confirm that they DO have an interest in the vehicle, which will confirm my suspicion that I shouldn't buy a surety bond.)\n\n***My general questions, in bold:***\n\nIf Covert Autogroup (who accepted the car from the previous owner as a trade-in) isn't responsive, ***how can I find out who the dealer bought the car from?*** (Carfax shows that a title was issued\/update in Jan 2020, but has no info about to whom.)\n\nIf I FIND them, ***WHAT exactly am I asking them to do that will make things right?*** Sign some form? Give me a letter of release of interest?\n\nIf I choose to move forward with a bonded title, remember that I'm military and intended to register in Nevada ... Nevada won't accept bonded titles for out-of-state registrations, and I understand Texas won't allow transfers of bonded titles out of state. I'm not a TX resident, but I guess I could attempt to register in Texas and that might work for a bit. But I'm soon scheduled to leave Texas (for my next duty assignment,) and will no longer be physically in the state for the required 3-5 years a bonded title needs to be maintained. My driver's license and insurance are with my home state of Nevada ... ***Should I attempt to register in Texas if I'm not a resident, won't be in the state, and have no intention of returning to Texas? If Nevada won't accept a bonded title, I'm not sure how else I can register.***\n\n***Finally, if I'm tired of fighting, how can I just wash my hands of this?*** If:\n\n* ... I'm willing to concede there is no acceptable resolution;\n* ... if I don't want to risk getting a bonded title and having to repay the surety bond and be liable for twice the amount of the car;\n* ... if I can't register in Nevada with a bonded title;\n* ... if I shouldn't register in Texas because I'm not a resident and won't be in the state for the 3-year bonded title requirement;\n* ... if my lawsuit results in default judgement I can't collect from a bankrupt dealership;\n* ... if I'm willing to repay USAA the auto loan anyway ...\n\n... What can I do with the car? I assume I can't sell a car I don't appear to legally own, yet it's a perfectly fine car. (And, if I had a bonded title, I assume no one would want to buy it anyway.) ***My end goal is to prove ownership of the car and register it in my home state of Nevada. If I can't do this under my current circumstances, what's the right way to just eat the losses and move on?***\n\nMy legal questions:\n\nBased on multiple reports from at least 30 other victims who got scammed by the same dealership, I believe the dealership intentionally sold cars they knew they couldn't provide title to. They took me for $25k (through my bank,) and I didn't get what I paid for (a car WITH title.) ***Why does no one seem to think this is a crime?*** I called the police, my bank, the Texas DMV, the TX Attorney General, etc. While everyone agrees its a messed up situation, no one seems to be concerned that they're doing this. ***Is this NOT a crime?***\n\nWhile I do have a lawyer who's working a DTP lawsuit, it was REALLY hard to find him. Most lawyers wouldn't touch my case, I assume because there wasn't enough money in it for them. Additionally, he warns that he is only focused on the DTP and can't\/won't help with my DMV\/registration issues. ***With both Texas and Nevada's rules limiting my ability to register a car I purchased legally, what legal assistance can I hire to help me navigate this?***\n\nTLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank\/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. DTP suit pending, but can't find legal help wading through DMV issues.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you know a traffic cop with access to NLETS you could see if they’d be willing to run the VIN for you and see what comes back — it would be against the rules but if they did it on shift it’s unlikely to ever be noticed.

Take a step back and breathe. Yes, this is incredibly frustrating. I’m sorry it happened. But I don’t think things are as bad as you may be thinking they are.\n\nIt sounds like work is still progressing. Which is good. It means your landlord intends to complete the work and is actively working towards it. \n\nAnd then there’s the $500 off. Given it’s been 2 weeks, that’s $1,000\/mo. Which is a pretty sizable and reasonable discount. They wouldn’t be offering this is their intention was to screw you over.\n\nYes, they are likely required to provide the kitchen re: habitability; however, they would also be given a reasonable period of time to remedy. (And offering to reduce\/discount your rent helps their case too).\n\nYour lease likely has a clause in it that said that if they were unable to deliver, they could keep you out and prorate for a month. So, by comparison, is it better having no kitchen and reduced rent for a month? Or would you rather they have pushed your move in back a month at the start? Again, sounds like they are at least trying (or maybe they just wanted the money).\n\nMy advice? Sit down with the landlord and work out a schedule for completion. Don’t push them for quicker results, just emphasize getting a real and firm timeline that you can hold them to. Discuss work hours and notification for unit access re: work. Ask that the $500 be at a rate of $1,000 per month paid biweekly until work is completed. (They’ll push back on this, that’s fine, just require a monthly concession until work is completed so that they’re incentivized to finish).\n\nOnce everything is settled, send an e-mail memorializing everything and ask for a reply to confirm receipt\/understanding. From there, hold them to it. If they miss more deadlines, then you can demand more or go to court.\n\nAs a practical matter, there are also door stops you can install which prevent the door from being opened while you are home. These are cheap, don’t damage anything, and force LL to notify you before entering while you are home.\n\nHope this helps! END"}

Overall I quit because of how uncomfortable I felt. \n\nOn my way out, my manager handed me a non-disclosure agreement with an offer of weekly pay for a month.

I know it feels silly for just a little scratch or a single toothmark but you want to make sure there's a record by a neutral 3rd party.  And same thing: dog mouths aren't very clean, it's far easier to take some preventative antibiotics than it is to get septicemia and have to sue her for damages later. \n\nYou may not know if these dogs are current on vaccines, it's important to be careful. The officer may have included in the report whether he confirmed rabies vaccs with her vet.

Selling to him or transferring to him could cause fraud headaches later on once you're passed. What will happen (at least in my experience in Colorado) is even debts that are not considered joint debts will attempt to be paid off via anything that you own (house, cars, boats, collections of obscure things etc) selling or transferring ownership of these things to him can raise some huge red flags in regards to fraud. Another potential option would be instead of transferring anything, get divorced and in your annulment agreement claim what debts are to be yours in order to get a court order that says he is not responsible for said debts. Now I know you mentioned earlier youre in a common law state which would mean if you continue to live together, you would need to be very careful to avoid any sort of common law marriage clause from taking effect (ie calling each other your spouse) but looking into it further and finding what defines common law marriage in your state would be wildly important for this path.

Now... Some creditors won't do this sort of thing, but it honestly is more of a hassle than it's worth. My recommendation, and I see you already are on it, is find an estate lawyer to help you split things apart to prevent the headache for him. Sorry to speak so frankly about it, I can't imagine how hard this is for you, but it is deff something you need to deal with before it becomes a problem. As well, just something to keep in mind, if you are able to completely separate everything, any amount you would put towards said debt, instead (personally I) would set it aside in cold cash\/in a bank in his name, to assist in everything after. It sucks talking about your own death like this, but money is a huge thing when someone dies. Do you have any adult children? END"}
{"prompt":" Q: My Mom was exposed to COVID by a doctor who came in while sick. The doctor performed surgeries while positive with COVID, is there anything I can do?\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a little long so I apologize, i'm also on a throwaway account. I got a call from my mom (60F, lives in PA) today and she told me that she was exposed to COVID-19 by one of the doctors that she works with. The doctor had come into work with a fever claiming that it was a sinus infection. Three days later he tested positive for COVID-19 and my mom was made aware of the possible exposure by her manager after the doctor tested positive. She is quarantining without pay, and the office that she works for told her she can use her PTO time but will otherwise be unpaid.\n\nShe was exposed while eating lunch in their break room. She was not wearing a mask (because she was eating lunch) and the doctor was also in the room with her. Long story short, not only was he maskless, but he decided to eat off her directly off my mothers plate without her permission. My mother was tested but we're still waiting on results.\n\nOn top of that, the doctor was seeing patients and **performing surgeries on patients** **while sick.** When my mom told me that I just couldn't believe it. After our conversation I couldn't stop thinking about all of the people who were potentially exposed and further unknowingly exposing their loved ones at home. I called her back and we filed a COVID complaint form in the state that she lives in anonymously because she is terrified of losing her job over this.\n\nThe doctors office is not closed down, and the doctor plans on returning to the office this week which is a week earlier than is safe to go back after testing positive. The office did not close down, and did not properly sanitize after finding out that the doctor tested positive. Who knows how many people have been exposed in that office.\n\nMy question is, is there anything else we can or should do? I'm worried that the office will continue BAU and the doctor will return potentially exposing more patients and other nurses. I don't know how timely the complaints are addressed, and I can't stop thinking about people potentially getting exposed.  I'm angry that a doctor would go to work with a fever during a pandemic and put my mother, patients, nurses, others at risk.

That's an unprovable allegation. All of us, no matter how careful we are, are exposed to positive people every time we leave our house.

As I’m sure you’re aware, you could certainly talk to police and try to get this guy charged in connection with what he did to you. Depending on the nature of the allegations, he could wind up in adult court or be prosecuted in juvenile court. As other posters have indicated, an anonymous tip is not useful — the defendant has a right to confront his accusers in court. If you offered to testify on behalf of your friend, you would be known as an “other crimes” witness. This type of evidence is generally deemed admissible, especially in sex cases. One thing to ponder —if the offender knows that there are a bunch of victims lined up to testify against him, he might be more likely to plead guilty and spare everyone a trial. If you’re in Cook County, please be aware that cases can take a LONG time to resolve; it could be years before this goes to trial, if at all. You would not be alone — at least in Cook County, there is a victim witness assistance unit — staff members accompany you to court and generally guide you through the process.

{"prompt":" Q: [Prince William County, Virginia] Dispute brewing with the neighbors over property use and access rights\nT: GOOD\nB: I purchased a home approximately three months ago not knowing there was a path everyone in the neighborhood uses that cuts right through my property to a trail behind my house. This was not disclosed by the previous owner at the period of inspection. Since my family and I have been here, we have experienced people walking their dogs off-leash on our property (we have a small child, so this makes us nervous), allowing their dogs to defecate on our property and not cleaning it up, and taking the fruit off our tree in our front yard. In addition to this, we have had the trees inspected on our property by a professional, licensed arborist and they have informed us that there is at least one dead tree dangerously leaning over that path on our property. So, (1) we do not want to deal with people disrespecting our property nor, (2) the liability of someone possibly getting injured on our property.\n\nThe path appears to have been there for a quite a while and it abuts HOA common ground. Since the property line is unclear and, (talking to one of the neighbors) it has never been done before, we hired a licensed surveyor to come out and stake the property. We then requested that the HOA establish the path OFF of our property and onto their common ground (about 10' away) and allow us to put up \"no trespassing\" signs to discourage people from using our property as a conduit to that trail. They agreed and we have done that. Now it seems some of the neighbors have been inflamed, as they have been using that path for many many years, and there is talk of them getting together and asking the county to declare that portion of our property an easement to which they are entitled to continue using.\n\nWhen speaking to one of our more sympathetic neighbors, he told us that the previous homeowner's father was not happy about people walking through the yard either and kept having to chase people off the property. The previous homeowner was Korean and lived here with her Korean parents. I don't think English was their first language, so some of her dad's efforts might have gotten lost in translation. We know less about the homeowner before them, but from what our next door neighbor describes, they didn't know where the property line was or had forgotten about it, and were a lot more comfortable with sharing their personal property with the neighbors anyway. We suspect they were older, better insured, and more financially secure than we are that they did not mind shouldering that kind of risk and burden.\n\nSo my question is, do the neighbors have a legal leg to stand on? Can they have our property declared an easement (it currently isn't one, we've checked), and if so, do we need to legally pursue the previous homeowner for compensation for not disclosing this issue to us during our inspection period?\n\nETA: So this is even more complicated than I first thought. My husband just informed me that the HOA has landscaping on either side of the path (all on our property) that they've been maintaining for many years. In other words, an encroachment. However, they would have had to apply for this and needed to ensure that whatever landscaping they established was not on anyone's property, but on common ground instead. Unfortunately, and we are trying to get the application records from our HOA to confirm, it doesn't appear that they did. Additionally, the previous homeowner that failed to disclose all of this to us is a licensed real estate agent. \n\nETA 2: Since many people have suggested I just put up a fence and be done with it, that would be a goal, but as of now, the HOA covenants do not allow front yard fences. This is part of my frustration because I feel if the previous owners had been able to fence in their front yard, maybe I would never be in this position in the first place. I feel the HOA convenants prevented the previous homeowners reasonable protection from encroachments because they were never allowed to put up a fence, and the first homeowner lived here so long and was so old by the time he left, he forgot where the property line even was. Had he been allowed to put up a fence and define the property, we might have never gotten here in the first place.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" IANAL but from what I’ve read I find it unlikely the neighbors would have success getting an easement for the walking path if there is a newly diverted path on the HOA common property to access the trail. If they come onto your property, alert them they are trespassing and ask them to leave, then call the cops if they refuse. Post no-trespassing signs. I find it unlikely your neighbors will go to the trouble and expense to move beyond complaining and actually hire an attorney and take this to a judge, and even less likely a judge would grant an easement when an alternative route exists 10’ from the path through your property.

Additionally, the previous homeowner that failed to disclose all of this to us is a licensed real estate agent. \n\nETA 2: Since many people have suggested I just put up a fence and be done with it, that would be a goal, but as of now, the HOA covenants do not allow front yard fences. This is part of my frustration because I feel if the previous owners had been able to fence in their front yard, maybe I would never be in this position in the first place. I feel the HOA convenants prevented the previous homeowners reasonable protection from encroachments because they were never allowed to put up a fence, and the first homeowner lived here so long and was so old by the time he left, he forgot where the property line even was. Had he been allowed to put up a fence and define the property, we might have never gotten here in the first place.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you so much for your response, and we feel the same way.

Depending on the use, a typical leech field only lasts 25-40 years.  They will need to move it at some point. \nAlso some governments have pre-approved locations for moving leech fields. You should have the neighbors figure out where thier town\/County will approve thier next leech field.  It would be good for you to make sure your property is not a part of the next leech field.

I was  there for nearly 3 years.\n\nSo that  means I've been applying for jobs. One of the first jobs was a makeup  company who I won't name here - they aren't hugely well known but they  seem quite established.\n\nI got  through to the second stage of the interview - which was designing  infographics for Amazon adverts. I was a bit hesitant about this,  knowing they could very well steal my ideas but thought I was being  paranoid, as quite often in designer roles you're asked to do this. Also  in the brief it specifically said it was just to establish our skill  set.\n\nI looked at their existing  adverts on Amazon and they weren't particularly nice - a green back  ground with kind of pink ink splodge clip art. Their logo is  monochromatic so I thought I'd design the advert in black and white -  with diagonal split screens and close ups of either ends of the  makeupdrush (it was a duet brush so I was doing this to highlight it's  different functions). I even played with placing the photograph of the  brush diagonally to match the split screens. Anyway in the end it looked  really good (Sorry for nerdy rant).\n\nI  sent it off and got invited to the final stage of the interview. Before  I went I noticed the design office was on an industrial estate really  far from where I live - I don't drive so that's an issue. Plus due to  covid, quite a lot of companies are letting people work from home on  some days - but they confirmed to me I'd need to be on site every day.

In my offer letter they noted my start date and the hourly, biweekly, and annual salary.\n\nMonday was my first official day on the job (I participated in online orientation the week prior) and I received a phone call from HR informing me that my salary would actually be 15-20% lower than what was written on the job offer I signed when I accepted the job.\n\nThere is a wee bit of complexity in that I work a school-year schedule but am on payroll as a FTE. So since I started after the beginning of the school year, I am supposed to receive a “pro-rated” salary, less than I would get if I started the first day of the school year. This was noted in the offer. They even created a table showing the days I would be working within the year. However, the math in their table resulted in the biweekly and annual salary that matched the offer listed at the top page of my job description.\n\nEssentially, they messed up their math. I did not double check their math. For context, we’re talking a difference of under 10k here but, being a mental health worker that is a significant part of the income I was depending on.\n\nDo I have any legal ground to stand on here?

Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, but that could just be that we moved here with no furniture and slept on the ground for a few months.\n\nOur lease ends in January and I'm taking every step I can to get my security deposit back from our apartment complex. Thankfully its in pretty decent condition after 2 years, so I wasn't too worried until this morning.\n\nYesterday we took out all our clothes, bedding, couch cushion covers and started washing everything to pack away. The first thing we washed was our bed cover, and it turns out the inner layer surrounding the memory foam is a fiberglass blend (the inner layer does not have a zipper, and does not come off. We washed the outer layer). I don't think companies are required to disclose this or put it on tags, but in case it matters, neither of those things happened.\n\nThis morning I woke up suffocating. I panicked, ran to the kitchen to get some water, and hacked my lungs out for 10-15 minutes. My fiance woke up with a rash, and I had a small one too.\n\nThere's fiberglass EVERYWHERE.\n\nI can't sit on the furniture in my house or wear any of the clothes we had in laundry piles without immediately getting itchy. We can't shower without drying off with paper towels, because our towels are also covered. We're going to try and wash one set of clothes a bunch of times as a control group to see if it'll help, but we're freaking out. We can't renew our lease here, and we can't afford to replace half our belongings before moving to a new place, let alone any cleaning costs for getting fiberglass out of an apartment.\n\nI looked for a website and support number, but neither exist. I found the company that manufactures the mattresses, and the company that imports them for sale at retailers in Utah (separate companies) but everybody I talk to seems to think there's no fiberglass in mattress covers. I hadn't heard of it either, and I feel like a dick but I had a nasty argument with the fiance about it too, so I googled it and its not uncommon.

{"prompt":" Q: Someone from the city came by requesting an easement\nT: GOOD\nB: A few months ago a construction company placed a water pipe in my yard.  They also knocked down several of my large trees in my tree line that starts about 30 feet from the center of the road which made my home a lot less private. I was not told that they would be removing my trees and they did not remove any of my neighbors trees where they were installing the pipe.  It appears that they negligently drove an excavator into my trees.  I couldn't find any evidence of an easement or any clear literature explaining right of way in my county, or get ahold of the specific contractor that did the damage so I just decided to let it go.\n\nMy neighborhood is zoned county, but is surrounded by city limits. A developer bought 17 acres across the street from me and is building a 64 unit cookie cutter neighborhood and the 17 acre lot was annexed by the city as part of the project approval.\n\nYesterday I received a call from a woman claiming to be with the city asking for an easement on my property for \"an electrical project\".

She also mentioned that the guys that are selling that house, had heard that we have access to a tractor (brother in law lives on the other side, and is friends with HIS neighbor who I think owns a tractor- we've never even spoken to them), so we don't have access to one, and she can't tell me to use it lol?) She wasn't brazen enough to tell me what exactly to do, just to do something. We don't have the money to do anything right now. I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. I'm really in a rut. Thanks for any help!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you can contact prior owners or older neighbors and show that the driveway has been shared for at least 21 years, that will help prove a prescriptive easement.\n\nThe fact that the back third of the driveway and the carport require the driveway to be shared to make any sense also helps, moreso if the carport is &gt;21 years old.

{"prompt":" Q: I think I am being extorted\/threatened by my friend's boyfriend over evidence of abuse?\nT: GOOD\nB: I dont know if extorted is the right term. Sorry if it isn't. \n\nIt all started two weeks ago when I was hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend. He is a jerk, but he was being particularly mean that night and by the end he was kicking and hitting her. I was scared for both of us so I texted my sister and asked her to call the police. When the got there, they had stopped fighting, but I told the police what happened. They denied it and claimed that they were in a verbal argument and I was basically lying. The cops didn't really do anything. \n\nThe next day her boyfriend came to my house and screamed at me and threatened me. My sister recorded what he said, which was basically admitting to the abuse (but not exactly). When I told him I was calling the police and that I now have proof he ran off and I assumed it was over.\n\nThen he started texting me the next day on snapchat saying that if I did anything else he would have my dad deported. My dad is here on greencard (I was born here and my mom and sister are now citizens though). He has an older brother that works for ICE, so I think he might actually be able to do it. I am really scared but I havent told my parents because I dont want to scare them more. My dad is here legally, but he does do handyman work sometimes which isn't exactly legal (he takes cash payments) and could be a violation of labor laws. \n\nI want to help my friend, but like I don't want this to hurt my dad. We can't really afford lawyers, but I was wondering if I am right, is this extortion and can anything be done about it? And, how likely is it that there are legal grounds to deport my father?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is blackmail rather than extortion, but I think their threat to deport is baseless. They are just using a connection to intimidate you into silence. Screenshot any and all threats (yes, even though Snapchat tells them you took a screenshot, still do it).\n\nA papertrail is important if you need to involve the police. \"Your word\" against his is a bad spot. Gathering evidence of this blackmail and laying out a chain of events will be key in protecting your family.\n\nIf worse comes to worse, you won't need a lawyer as this threat is criminal and the state will prosecute for it.

But we didn’t fight it and let it go) Another time they sent us a lease violation for leaving one bag of trash outside of our door on a rainy day. (We have a trash compactor that is a drive away, so taking it while it’s raining is a bit of a hassle. We didn’t fight this either) All of these incidences were prior to us transferring to the townhome that we live in now. We are in a completely different lease since May. In-between all of the years and the different “incidents” I have frequently butted heads with the property manager.

We received a strange e-mail at eleven at night that I didn’t see until midnight. The property manager emailed me, not even addressing me by name, and stated that they received a report about potential domestic violence from our unit. This, of course, is totally insane. In the email she said she had contacted our local police department to pull any reports that may have been made to them about our specific address, and she also said that they made a report. I called the police department and spoke to several different people, including the officer that was patrolling the area that night. I asked if they had any reports at all about our address, if they had been asked to pull reports about our address and if they had been told to dispatch to our location.

If we receive another complaint or police report they will have to give us a 30 days notice to vacate.” \n\nAgain, we have had no noise complaints for this new unit and new lease. We also have had no conferences so I have no idea what this is all about? And we certainly have had no police reports filed. Is she just blowing smoke to scare us? Did she not handle something properly and she’s trying to cover her tracks? Can she legitimately evict us off of NOTHING?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It might be an ongoing issue for your neighbors if you don’t really follow the hours. Sometimes the leasing office won’t send a warning every time they receive a complaint. I’ve complained about my neighbors marijuana use over 10 times and I think they’ve only been warned 3 times. \n\nI’d definitely try to stay within quiet hours if you haven’t already. The domestic abuse could have been a previous address, accidental email instead of noise complaint, or your landlord is making false claims. \n\nIf it is a leasing company, there is always someone above her you can address concerns to if she is in fact claiming false information to evict you.

It makes sense.  \n\nFor example, you have to have a diploma to enlist in the military.  The state is certifying that this HS graduate has met the minimum academic requirements to have the diploma.\n\nIf the Department of Education in your state learned students could pay to improve their grade, they would lose their collective minds.\n\nGrades are important.

{"prompt":" Q: [Maryland] Neighbor refused access to remove dying tree on property line\nT: GOOD\nB: I have a tree on my property line that is dying and needs to be removed before it falls on its own. I've had multiple arborists come out and tell me that it needs to be removed. It does not appear to be in imminent danger of falling, but it is clearly in decline. \n\nI spoke to the neighbor about removing the tree and while they seemed enthusiastic about having it gone, they made it quite clear that my contractors were not allowed on their land to do the job. I've since taken another look at the tree and I'm not convinced that the trunk is wholly on my property. I believe it has grown several inches onto the neighbor's land.\n\nI know that generally when a tree or branch falls, cleanup is the responsibility of the person who owns the property where it fell. The exception to that is if that owner can show negligence by the person whose land the tree was on before it fell. How does that change if the tree's trunk is located on both properties?

In Maryland, ownership of a tree is determined by the location of the trunk. The trunk is located on the boundary line and trees located on a boundary line are considered joint property. No single neighbor can decide to remove the tree. You can, however, trim the tree back to the property line, provided that doing so does not injure the tree.\n\nNeither you, nor your neighbor have any liability to each other for damages from the tree In [*Melnick v.

{"prompt":" Q: Being stalked and harassed by my ex boyfriend since April 2020\nT: GOOD\nB: Hello redditors,\n\nComing to you guys since the police seem unable to do anything despite textbook stalking, cyberstalking and harassment by my ex boyfriend who I broke up with April 2020.\n\nList of things he has done:\n\n1. Attempted to break into my apartment twice while I was not home, left a spare key he must have copied from me in the doorknob\n\n2. Showed up at my apartment randomly numerous times\n\n3. Was caught by security officers at my school campus attempting to break into my car, was seen laying under my car with a black box in hand, which he ran off with when the security officer saw him\n\n4. Drove by my current boyfriend’s house at the exact time I pulled up\n\n5. Showed up at a remote nature spot I was at in full face covering\n\n6. Due to the above events I looked for a tracking device on my car and FOUND ONE. The police currently have the tracking device\n\n7. Hacked approximately 15 of my accounts, attempted deletion, successfully deleted or changed passwords of a couple\n\n8. Cancelled my plane tickets for a future trip\n \n9. Disabled my car at least twice\n\n10. Has called approximately 50 times from a blocked number \n\nHe owns legal and illegal guns. He is an alcoholic and drug user. His father is a known criminal and murderer. I am scared for my life of him yet the police can’t do anything about it since there are no overt threats or explicit proof that it was all him. I have tried to get an injunction for stalking but was directed by my lawyer that I may be in more danger if I attempt it, or attempt it and don’t get it, since historically that is when the most domestic violence occurs. I was also told that stalking cases are notoriously hard to prove. I don’t understand why the police themselves cannot charge him, especially with the tracking device in their possession. \n\nPlease direct me in the right direction as this has continued for months and has no indication of stopping, as the most recent event was last night. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\n[Florida]\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Fire your attorney.\n\nFind a new attorney, get in contact with the various domestic violence groups in your area.  Tell them everything you have listed here.  Just one of those bullet points is enough for a TRO.  \n\nFire your attorney.  Did I say that one yet?\n\nGo to the police, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.  Report every iota of evidence you have, meet with detectives who specialize in this area.  Do not allow yourself to be put on hold or dismissed -- explain that you are in fear for your life and are the victim of a crime.  Get your new attorney to ensure all information is sent along to the prosecutor's office and see if they can get this fast-tracked.  Stuff like House of Ruth can provide useful resources.  If you move quickly, a TRO can be issued within the day and he will be served with the order and then ordered to attend court.  This is critical: IF he does in fact have the illegal guns with him, and if he is as unstable as he appears, this may end with his arrest.  Be ready for that outcome.\n\nSo to recap:\n\nFire your attorney.  Go to the police.  Seek resources for assistance.  FIRE YOUR ATTORNEY.\n\nYou are the victim of an ongoing criminal violation by your ex-boyfriend, and I cannot stress this enough _you must express the fear for your life to the appropriate entities_.

Airlines hate being fined by international authorities for immigration issues and this is on the high end (e.g. at one point United was loosing something like $10k a month in fines from Germany because people hadn't signed their passports).

The mechanic is asking for a total of 5,400 which includes 1,950 in storage fees for 30 days. I only have about a fifth of that. Shes only willing to take the 3 grand then the rest in payments and she wants a decision by the 21st. I do not have 3 grand. I tried to apply for many loans and have been denied. Im wondering what my options are at this point. Do I let the bank repossess it? Is the car worth getting out? I still owe 17,000 on the vehicle and I have over 6,000 in credit card debt that I've accumulated this year due to the first covid lockdown. I've heard of surrendering a vehicle but not sure how that would work and I would think I'd still have to pay the mechanic to do that.\n\nI tried to keep this as short and straight to point as possible.

She has been making payments on time but even if she couldn't make the payments, I would take care of it because I could afford it. That was my thought process at the time when I bought the car but it never occurred to me that she could pocket insurance money if an accident happened. She had me thinking everything was fine and she was gonna get the car from the mechanic but I had to find out the truth a month later from the bank. \n\n*I dont know why I wasnt contacted by the mechanic or insurance. I dont know why it took a month for the bank to call.\n\n*I spoke to the insurance company to ask why the check wasn't issued out to me or the mechanic and I was told that legally, since my moms the primary holder, she can request the check be sent to her under her name even though its only my name on the registration.\n\n*The mechanic filed the lien about a week ago\n\n*The car is worth 12 - 13k right now\n\n* I am located in California\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since everything is in your name, you are the responsible party unfortunately.

The vehicle is registered under my name only. I am on her insurance policy. She is the primary holder. She got into an accident recently and took the car to the mechanic for repairs. She received the insurance claim check and chose to spend the money on something else instead of getting the car out. I get a call a month later from the bank telling me about the situation (I was unaware of what was going on and assumed everything was being handled). They tell me that the mechanic is processing a lien and its going to get repossessed if I dont work it out with the mechanic. The mechanic is asking for a total of 5,400 which includes 1,950 in storage fees for 30 days. I only have about a fifth of that. Shes only willing to take the 3 grand then the rest in payments and she wants a decision by the 21st. I do not have 3 grand. I tried to apply for many loans and have been denied. Im wondering what my options are at this point. Do I let the bank repossess it? Is the car worth getting out? I still owe 17,000 on the vehicle and I have over 6,000 in credit card debt that I've accumulated this year due to the first covid lockdown. I've heard of surrendering a vehicle but not sure how that would work and I would think I'd still have to pay the mechanic to do that.\n\nI tried to keep this as short and straight to point as possible. If there's any questions I will gladly answer them. Any help is very much appreciated. I am 27 and made the wrong decision by trusting my mom and I dont want to make another bad decision. Thanks ahead of time.\n\n\nSome people were confused in the other sub so here are some more details:\n\n*My mom has a gambling addiction and it has become worse. She's homeless now and spends all her time at the casino. I realize now that I'm an idiot for buying her a car when I was aware of her gambling habit, but at the time I was convinced that everything would be fine. She has been making payments on time but even if she couldn't make the payments, I would take care of it because I could afford it. That was my thought process at the time when I bought the car but it never occurred to me that she could pocket insurance money if an accident happened. She had me thinking everything was fine and she was gonna get the car from the mechanic but I had to find out the truth a month later from the bank. \n\n*I dont know why I wasnt contacted by the mechanic or insurance. I dont know why it took a month for the bank to call.\n\n*I spoke to the insurance company to ask why the check wasn't issued out to me or the mechanic and I was told that legally, since my moms the primary holder, she can request the check be sent to her under her name even though its only my name on the registration.\n\n*The mechanic filed the lien about a week ago\n\n*The car is worth 12 - 13k right now\n\n* I am located in California\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Is your car paid off? Can you sell your car and raise some money for the mechanic's bill, and then use this car as your car? END"}

So, you are prohibited from driving for (on behalf of) your job. You are not prohibited from driving during lunch. That would be outrageous. Find out who the company has in house, or who they retain and ask your manager to get this clarified. Your leverage is that if they control you during lunch then maybe you should be getting paid for that time.

Then Monday night the internet went down  again and thankfully I didn't cancel the order for the tech.\n\nTech comes out Tuesday and tells us the story of fixing it Sat and that it was cut. He tells us that this time it had a lock and the lock was broken off and wires were cut again. He called the county police, we live in a small town of 75 people, and they came down, talked to a few people and left. The tech told us that it has cost approximately $2000 to fix it both times and asked us to try to see who was doing it. At this point I was pretty sure it was the neighbor, but the tech said there was a disgruntled employee and he thought maybe it was him.\n\nFast forward to last night. I hear some noise and go outside to see him fucking with the box. I go inside and the internet is now off, so I call the county police and they tell me the internet company has to call about it. I text the tech and tell him and call into company who schedules a fix and takes notes. \n\nThis morning tech shows up and calls cops. Cops say there is really nothing they can do, but they will set up cameras. Tech was pissed about it and decided to set up dummy wires and bury the real ones, so that he'd have to dig it up. The tech says it looked like he took an axe to the box. The tech is sketched out because the guy was circling the block watching him on Tuesday and today the guy is in his shed just watching them. \n\nNeighbor is a nut. Thinks that he can make forcefields on his vehicle and he can sharpen blades with the light from a flash light. I hate that he lives by us and hope that he goes to prison.

Best thing to do is to keep calling to have it fixed. Trust me repeat calls get a priority as it makes more work for technicians and for their dispatch. I would also mention you saw someone cut it any time it needs to be fixed and you observed the person cutting it. They will put that in the notes and for the company I worked for it only took an average of 2 fixes of witnessed purposeful tampering before police involvement was made. Eventually the company will have to make sure it does not keep happening by contacting local law enforcement In order to keep customers happy. END"}

They have been conducting more and more in-person interactions, presumably, so that they would never have to put anything they said in writing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am not sure if this is relevant, but she did file a complaint about 2 months ago with HR when she discovered that the administration had deliberately lied to her about two separate contacts that she had with covid positive staff.  The official guidance released by the school district stated that anyone in close contact with a covid infected person would mandated a 2 week quarantine.  The administration had told her that the first contacted person was sick with some other than covid and the second person informed her himself that he had had covid upon his return to work.  The school administration had said he was only taking some time off for family matters.  I can understand medical privacy being a concern, but he second person was someone that she works with in her classroom on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, don't know if this is going to get any useful responses.  But, I am worried that they are doing everything in their power to set her up for some kind of \"justified\" dismissal and unfortunately her panic attack causing her to leave today may have given them all the ammo they need to do it.  Should we seek professional legal advice?  If so what kind of lawyer would be best to consult?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" OP, is your wife part of a teachers union? They can absolutely help with this as far as the intimidation.\n\nAs far as grades. School systems are doing a lot of this to make sure kids don't fail. It is absolutely disturbing and the fact that I have seen many parents tell their kids they DO NOT have to go to online classes because of these internal policies not to fail kids is scary.\n\nAdministration can ultimately override her grades if they wish. Your wife would need to look into her contract as far as the \"improvement plan\". Ultimately contracts most likely dont take into consideration the current circumstances and most likely does have language that discussss a large amount of class failures as something that would reflect badly on her.\n\nMoving forward she may want to look into if she can involve truency for students not completing assignments. Many districts are still following truency guidelines in some fashion to hold parents accountable. If she can show these students have been referred for absenteeism than that will help her case.

An example is Diego Armando Maradona: he owed several milion dollars for unpaid taxes but Italian IRS couldn't do anything outside Italy.

Who was it that calculated the valuation of it being worth $1.4 million?  Does the trust document actually have language in it that gives the trustee the authority to sell it or close it?  Verbal agreements are worth nothing when the trust must be administered--the language of the trust must be strictly followed.\n\nDoes the company have a person in charge who is running\/managing things or is that you?  What are the monthly payroll expenses? Someone in the accounting department should be preparing monthly income statements that would show how much per month the business is making in net income\/profit (the money that is left over after expenses have been paid).  Is there enough business cash available for someone to start paying off the credit card debt and the accounts payable?  The $160K in accounts receivable is far too high, but certainly understandable.  It means that the company has been too trusting of its customers to let them go too long without paying their bills on time--you can correct that situation by having someone in the A\/R department to start aggressively making collection calls to ask for your money or by hiring a debt collection company to do the same thing, and if they are successful in collecting this could be a good source of future income for this company.  From this day forward, the customers your company does business for should be asked to put up a partial advance deposit before you do the work for them.  That will be an indication of their ability to pay and their willingness to pay.  Discuss all of these business aspects with the accountant you have worked with in the past (or with an accountant who has experience with businesses) and that person can advise you about what the business should be doing.\n\nYou can not let the beneficiaries or anyone else, prevent you from selling the business.  After you have worked the numbers with the accountant, you will be able to see in black and white whether the business can afford to continue or not.   I'm glad that you were able to at least mention some of the numbers involving the business operations, since that means that you are being informed about what is going on there.\n\nIf the trust does not name anyone to be a successor trustee, then you will have to consult with a trust attorney to figure out how a new trustee can be chosen.  The attorney can also help you figure out how to interpret the will and the trust--they are two separate documents that will be handled differently--the will will be handled in probate court and the trust will be managed privately, outside of court.

It can show that y'all aren't running some hawk hotel and that y'all are doing nothing to incite local wildlife to hurt her dogs.

I moved in maybe four or five months ago (time has lost all meaning during lockdown) to a new building. The day I moved in, I met a seemingly-nice old lady. \n\nShe helped me out one day when I was locked out of my apartment, and I left a thank you note and a small candy gift outside her door. Everything was polite and nice. \n\nBut then she started asking favors of me, scaling it up from one quick errand to a significant amount of chores, shopping, cleaning, etc. I told her I was on disability for a reason -- I have both physical and mental health disabilities -- and she made some rude comments insinuating I was lying about my depression.\n\nShe also started to try to sell me on her religion. She wanted to \"lay hands on\" me to \"heal [my] migraines\" and implied it would heal my depression as well. I politely declined and she asked about my family's religion. When I told her what it was and it was different than hers, she made faces and a few disparaging remarks, and ever since then has been trying in earnest to convert me, telling me my family's religion is fake and sinful and we're all going to hell and that my late grandparents are in hell.\n\nBy this time I'd known her for about a week, and she started saying \"I love you\" to me. Repeatedly. And I knew it was time to cut contact.\n\nIt was then that I started trying to distance myself from this woman. I asked her several times specifically *not* to get things for me at the store, but she would come to my door and hover outside it for minutes at a time, listening through the door -- sometimes while I was on zoom doing my therapy sessions, other times right around midnight -- and when I'd open the door to tell her to go away she'd act like she'd just gotten there and I hadn't heard her squeaky walker and shuffling feet come up the hallway ten minutes earlier and stop right outside my door. Then she'd give me things I'd asked her not to buy me.\n\nI stopped reciprocating with thank-you notes and return gifts when she gets me things I have asked her not to get me. I blocked her number and deleted the increasingly passive-aggressive voicemails because they made me uncomfortable (and were also filling up my mailbox). If I saw her in the laundry room and she hadn't spotted me, I'd leave as quickly as I could.\n\nBut sometimes she does spot me, and on several occasions she has blocked my exit from the laundry room or blocked me from going up the stairs to get away from her and gotten right up in my face. It's like a switch has been flipped. She's passive aggressive, she's outright aggressive. This little old lady scares me.\n\nAnd every time she corners me in the hallway, she starts calling me incessantly again. \n\nIt's been four or five months now. I blocked her number about two weeks into all this. Three weeks ago, I sent her a text asking her to not contact me again (she told me she texts her grandchildren and whatnot so I know she got it, she just didn't reply). Today I left a letter on her door. It was not rude, I did not insult her -- it just said something like \"hello, I have asked you multiple times not to contact me. Please stop calling my voicemail, coming to my door, leaving me things, etc. I want no further contact, not even for you to come to see me about this note.\"\n\nThen a little while later I came out of the elevator and bam, there she was. I tried ignoring her but she started following me. I asked her to leave me alone multiple times, but she kept saying, \"no, no,\" and I kept repeating myself: leave me alone. She started giggling madly then, and said in a sing-song, admonishing voice, \"you're *grumpy.*\" I told her I wasn't grumpy and that I wanted to be left alone. She said no over and over again and I tried to leave through the front door when she reached out to grab my arm to stop me.\n\nThat really scared me, as I grew up in an abusive household, and so before I even realized it I had yelled \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" That yell was enough to freeze her for just an instant, and I slipped out the door and out of the building. She yelled after me, \"*I'm going to report you!*\"\n\n**#TL;DR:**\n\nNeighbor lady was friendly at first, then scary. Blocks my exit and gets into my personal space. Does not listen when I have asked her not to contact me. Is now threatening to report me because I yelled at her to leave me alone when she was trying to grab me while I was trying to get away from her. \n\nHow do I go about getting a restraining order when our interactions have been in person ever since I blocked her number? I don't have the voicemails and she's never texted me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like this woman's mental state is deteriorating.

If I saw her in the laundry room and she hadn't spotted me, I'd leave as quickly as I could.\n\nBut sometimes she does spot me, and on several occasions she has blocked my exit from the laundry room or blocked me from going up the stairs to get away from her and gotten right up in my face. It's like a switch has been flipped. She's passive aggressive, she's outright aggressive. This little old lady scares me.\n\nAnd every time she corners me in the hallway, she starts calling me incessantly again. \n\nIt's been four or five months now. I blocked her number about two weeks into all this. Three weeks ago, I sent her a text asking her to not contact me again (she told me she texts her grandchildren and whatnot so I know she got it, she just didn't reply). Today I left a letter on her door. It was not rude, I did not insult her -- it just said something like \"hello, I have asked you multiple times not to contact me. Please stop calling my voicemail, coming to my door, leaving me things, etc. I want no further contact, not even for you to come to see me about this note.\"\n\nThen a little while later I came out of the elevator and bam, there she was. I tried ignoring her but she started following me. I asked her to leave me alone multiple times, but she kept saying, \"no, no,\" and I kept repeating myself: leave me alone. She started giggling madly then, and said in a sing-song, admonishing voice, \"you're *grumpy.*\" I told her I wasn't grumpy and that I wanted to be left alone. She said no over and over again and I tried to leave through the front door when she reached out to grab my arm to stop me.\n\nThat really scared me, as I grew up in an abusive household, and so before I even realized it I had yelled \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" That yell was enough to freeze her for just an instant, and I slipped out the door and out of the building. She yelled after me, \"*I'm going to report you!*\"\n\n**#TL;DR:**\n\nNeighbor lady was friendly at first, then scary. Blocks my exit and gets into my personal space. Does not listen when I have asked her not to contact me. Is now threatening to report me because I yelled at her to leave me alone when she was trying to grab me while I was trying to get away from her. \n\nHow do I go about getting a restraining order when our interactions have been in person ever since I blocked her number? I don't have the voicemails and she's never texted me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You can report her. You have no obligation to your fellow tenants. Make sure to write down and document everything, and even record your n your phone if you come into contact with her. Make sure it’s video or at least audio. This IS scary and no one should ever block an exit or listen outside your door at midnight. This behavior is not okay.\n\nEdit: words END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Ohio Real Estate Question: what kind of scam is this?\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi All-\n\nMy wife and I own a house that we are rehabbing in one of the big cities in Ohio.  This is not our primary residence; however, once the rehab is done, we intend to move in and make it our primary residence.  We have a mortgage on the place to pay for the rehab, so it's gone through an exhaustive title search.  (With this mortgage and a grant program, there are liens on this house that approximately equal or are greater than its value in its present condition.)  In its current condition, it is not livable- there is no running water, no walls, no flooring, no ceilings.\n\nThis neighborhood is gentrifying and as a result investors really want properties there.  We've had literally hundreds of people call asking to buy the place... we've had lots of complaints to city code enforcement in the hopes that we'd get tired of them and unload the place.\n\nOn Friday, my contractor called me and said that some guy dropped off a weird letter to one of his guys who was working on the place.  He asked me if I knew what was going on, and I had no idea.  The letter is handwritten and it reads:\n\n&gt;July 17, 2020  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NOTIFICATION OF EVICTION  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To whom it may concern:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On this seventeenth day of July 2020, all tenants, occupiers, occupants, residents, dwellers, lessees, and renters are provided a 10-day notice of eviction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The premises must be vacated by August 3, 2020 or further legal action may follow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This property has been claimed by Mr. A--- F--- who can be reached at (---) --------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Candidly,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A---- F----\n\nThe actual property address is not on the letter.

Mind you, it was supposed to be TEMPORARY. My sister tried to get her back when she was 8 months old the first time she tried. It wasn’t even that long! She was about a year and a half old when sister tried again.\n\nMy mom was giving my sister outrageous demands after she left her ex. Like she had to leave her husband, she had have her own place which she did do but mom didn’t like who she moved in with, parenting classes, etc. Every time Sister completed one of her “tasks” she’d give her another. Mom once took Niece and didn’t feel the need say anything to Sister because she “has custody” and when Sister was able to get ahold of Mom, it was a couple days later and Mom was threatening to never give her back because she didn’t call for a couple days.\n\nSister has had deal with this nonstop since she made the mistake of giving temporary custody to our mom because she thought she could trust her and is still dealing with it but now worse. My mom is stealing child support from Niece. \n\nSister has had Niece living with her since after her sixth birthday and my mom has not given a dime of Niece’s child support money (from her father) to my sister to help her out with basic needs. Mom technically still has legal temporary custody still but Niece is living with sister. Right at this moment, Niece barely has any clothes that fit, (I bought her some for her birthday this year) she needs new shoes, soap, you know basic needs! Stuff that would be easy to get if my mom wasn’t hoarding Niece’s child support money. \n\nIt seems illegal that Niece has been with Sister for nearly a year now and she hasn’t seen a dime of that money. Is it illegal?? What can Sister do about it????\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My mom became homeless and didn’t want to drag Niece into it so she at first sent Niece to live with her father but her father neglected her so instead she was sent to live with Sister last August and has been with her ever since.

The lawyer probably doesn't want to give it back to you directly due to liability. [EDIT: \/u\/ErikLovesBallons also mentioned that the income derived from the bike repair will help his client, so there's actually a vested interest in getting the bike back to the mechanic so he can begin working again.  EVERYONE wants that bike back to the mechanic, including OP in another comment!]\n\nThat's actually ~~the proper way~~ one good way to deal with this, in my (non-legal) opinion. Then you can deal directly with the mechanic, as you normally would have anyway.  INAL. END"}

The downstairs is another story. \n\nThe downstairs has been occupied by an older women who paid about $180-200 35 years ago and increased to what it is today, $300\/month.  She is now in the ending stages of her life. The apartment is also falling apart. She has been delinquent in reporting small issues until they are huge issues, but my dad has always corrected them when he sees them. Now it has become so bad that the entire bathroom needs to be gutted. The floor under the toilet is not sturdy. A leaking issue was recently corrected by tearing open a wall. \n\nTenant wants my father to replace the wall because of course, she doesn’t want to look at it.

She said she will not because she has no where to go. \n\nThe tenant’s adopted son recently disowned her because the tenant’s son and his wife found his biological mom and discovered that bio mom is very wealthy.

The tenant has been on a month-to-month for decades. I told my dad he should be worried that the apartment is unsafe and if anything happens to his tenant, that adopted, money-grubbing son of hers would sue the pants off of him. What can he do?

Do keep in mind he is liable for injuries that arose from the current state of the bathroom and unsafe conditions present, which she may bring to a landlord tenant board and have him fined for not fixing. You must give her a one month notice due before the rent date prior where it's effective. So if you want to get her out by Sept 1st you'll have to give your notice before Aug 1st, make sure to do this in writing not verbally, have a paper trail going. The son can sue anyone for anything, but he will have a hard time proving damages. Also this will probably put him in a bind with his rich bio mom if he's all of the sudden coming back to help his adopted mom, so he might just continue on the same path since he is greedy. You're only other option is to pay for a different accommodation for her (like a motel) while the renovations are taking place, but that is a terrible idea financially and you have no lease which requires that, terminating the tenancy is the \"cleanest\" option for you to avoid liability.

{"prompt":" Q: Girlfriend (21) was sexually assaulted by her \"Mentor\" (57)\nT: GOOD\nB: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nMy girlfriend (21 - I'll call her Sarah) and I met our Junior year of college. We are both ambitious people and made the most of our professional development in college by attending company events, conferences etc. At a conference, Sarah met someone that would enter our lives as her mentor, and later would be somewhat of a mentor to me by association. I'll call this mentor Bobby (Male 57 year old). Bobby calls himself a christian man and is very involved in church with his wife as relationship counselors for newly engaged couples. He is also very successful in his career, sits on millions of dollars and has a lot of connections at big companies. Sarah is very strong in her faith and saw Bobby as a great mentor for her spiritually and in her professional development. They began meeting for lunch and discussing personal growth and overall life goals. Before long, Bobby had gained Sarah and I's trust. He was becoming a mentor to me (when I was around Sarah) but never reached out to me like he did with her. We would come to him with relationship advice and trusted his guidance as a counselor, even though he would favor Sarah's side even when she knew she was wrong.\n\nFast forward to us graduating college and starting our careers. Sarah gained gained absolute trust in Bobby and began to see him as a father. Hell, I even looked up to the guy. We were looking somewhere to live in a metro area to be close to work. Bobby lives in a more suburban area away from the metro area, but this didn't stop him from suggesting that we look for apartments in the town he lives. After looking, Sarah decided her favorite apartment was one which was around a mile away from Bobby and his wife's house. I told her that the location was much further away from the metro area, and that it would be mildly inappropriate to move so close to this guy that takes an unusual and eccentric interest in her professional development. After not coming to agreement of a better place to live, Bobby invited her to come sign the lease, and spent 45 minutes on the phone manipulating her into thinking that this was a choice she should make on her own and independent of me. He also suggested she sign the lease and tell me after.\n\nI lost a lot of trust because of this and told her that he was manipulating her, and wanted her close to him. I also thought the situation was getting creepy, and that he had surpassed me in Sarah's loyalty. I talked to Sarah about this and told her that I'd move in, but we need to limit contact with Bobby because he influences her to do things which are not good for our relationship. She agreed. With all the trust I lost over the signing of the lease, I became hypersensitive to what Sarah was doing and was monitoring her, catching her in little white lies left and right. We constantly fought about my loss of trust in her, and with no where to turn we phoned Bobby, who again took her side. He called me and had a one on one after our joint call, and told me that I needed to work on trust. At this point he would come over when I was not there, and help Sarah set up investment accounts. He would invite Sarah to run in the mornings without me knowing the next few days after my one on one phone call, and would say that I am not the right guy for her and that I may be the devil (lol).\n\nA couple of days later, he invited Sarah over to have a one on one with him in person. He said that I can't know about it, and that she needed to hide it. When she arrived he had wine ready out back for them to have their talk. He began saying that Im not the guy Sarah should marry, and that I'm not good for her. He mentioned that he normally mentors people in a few areas, and that sexuality was one of them. He said he and Sarah hadn't touched that topic. He then began asking about sex and pushed for details. Bobby insisted that Sarah didn't know what it was like to be pleasured.

I'll call this mentor Bobby (Male 57 year old). Bobby calls himself a christian man and is very involved in church with his wife as relationship counselors for newly engaged couples. He is also very successful in his career, sits on millions of dollars and has a lot of connections at big companies. Sarah is very strong in her faith and saw Bobby as a great mentor for her spiritually and in her professional development. They began meeting for lunch and discussing personal growth and overall life goals. Before long, Bobby had gained Sarah and I's trust. He was becoming a mentor to me (when I was around Sarah) but never reached out to me like he did with her. We would come to him with relationship advice and trusted his guidance as a counselor, even though he would favor Sarah's side even when she knew she was wrong.\n\nFast forward to us graduating college and starting our careers. Sarah gained gained absolute trust in Bobby and began to see him as a father. Hell, I even looked up to the guy. We were looking somewhere to live in a metro area to be close to work. Bobby lives in a more suburban area away from the metro area, but this didn't stop him from suggesting that we look for apartments in the town he lives. After looking, Sarah decided her favorite apartment was one which was around a mile away from Bobby and his wife's house. I told her that the location was much further away from the metro area, and that it would be mildly inappropriate to move so close to this guy that takes an unusual and eccentric interest in her professional development. After not coming to agreement of a better place to live, Bobby invited her to come sign the lease, and spent 45 minutes on the phone manipulating her into thinking that this was a choice she should make on her own and independent of me.

Hopefully this can still help. The management company I work for breaks down the rent make-up in a strange way due to the accounting system we use. Let’s say the rent base is $2000 and that is on your lease for what your monthly rent should be (before utilities, etc.). The resident would see a $50 balcony charge, $200 water view, $30 third floor fee. All in all, the base rent is still $2000, but the breakdown is given to show what the rent is comprised of. On top of that they would see minor charges for utilities and the breakdown would be there for water, sewer, and common electric charges. Any other “rental items,” like garage fees or storage fees would be tacked on, too.\n\nYou have the right to see what your ledger looks like. Also, compare what you’ve paid in the past to what they are charging now. Definitely comb through your lease. Ultimately, this Covid thing left landlords and management companies scrambling.

{"prompt":" Q: [CA] Buyer refusing to close escrow, threatening to sue for 120k\nT: GOOD\nB: My grandmother owns a building from which she runs a struggling business in CA. Last year, she decided to finally sell the building since everything was going down the toilet and she could no longer handle the mortgage by herself.\n\nRight away, she found a buyer. The buyer asked for an extended escrow (1 year) and that they would pay her $10k in advance per month, out of the deposit. The contract they signed stipulates that that money is nonrefundable.\n\nHowever, over one year later, the buyer is now refusing to close escrow. They are also refusing to sign the contract termination form. It’s been over 8 months since close of escrow was supposed to happen. The buyer at first was ignoring her agent’s emails, then responding very rudely and flippantly.\n\nMy grandma scraped together what she could and hired a lawyer who basically did the bare minimum and is now refusing to pick up her calls. The lawyer told her that she needs to do arbitration\/mediation, and when she consulted to try and do that, we were told it would cost her over $10,000+, money she absolutely does not have. So they have been at a stalemate.\n\nMy grandma just received a message from the buyer saying that they would only sign to terminate the contract if she returned the $120k fully to them. Additionally, they said that if she did not return the money, and agree to returning the money within 24 hours, they would sue her for every penny.\n\nAt this point, my grandma has received $120k total (1 year x $10k per month) which has all gone towards barely keeping us afloat. She no longer has a cent of that money. Returning that money is out of the question.\n\nShe cannot afford another lawyer.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I am guessing they are just bluffing about suing her over the money, since the contract itself says it is nonrefundable.

{"prompt":" Q: [CA] Buyer refusing to close escrow, threatening to sue for 120k\nT: BAD\nB: My grandmother owns a building from which she runs a struggling business in CA. Last year, she decided to finally sell the building since everything was going down the toilet and she could no longer handle the mortgage by herself.\n\nRight away, she found a buyer. The buyer asked for an extended escrow (1 year) and that they would pay her $10k in advance per month, out of the deposit. The contract they signed stipulates that that money is nonrefundable.\n\nHowever, over one year later, the buyer is now refusing to close escrow. They are also refusing to sign the contract termination form. It’s been over 8 months since close of escrow was supposed to happen. The buyer at first was ignoring her agent’s emails, then responding very rudely and flippantly.\n\nMy grandma scraped together what she could and hired a lawyer who basically did the bare minimum and is now refusing to pick up her calls. The lawyer told her that she needs to do arbitration\/mediation, and when she consulted to try and do that, we were told it would cost her over $10,000+, money she absolutely does not have. So they have been at a stalemate.\n\nMy grandma just received a message from the buyer saying that they would only sign to terminate the contract if she returned the $120k fully to them. Additionally, they said that if she did not return the money, and agree to returning the money within 24 hours, they would sue her for every penny.\n\nAt this point, my grandma has received $120k total (1 year x $10k per month) which has all gone towards barely keeping us afloat. She no longer has a cent of that money. Returning that money is out of the question.\n\nShe cannot afford another lawyer.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I am guessing they are just bluffing about suing her over the money, since the contract itself says it is nonrefundable.

Unfortunately, the responses are right. Somehow your grandmother needs to come up with the money for a lawyer. This is not something she can handle herself. Borrow from family, friends, get a bank loan, maybe they'll take a percentage of the building value, who knows. Do whatever possible. This is definitely lawyer territory. END"}

Those contracts that were signed originally need to be interpreted so she knows where she stands. Also, a real estate attorney will know what her rights are with regard to cancelling the contract in response to the buyer’s inability to financially perform. There are usually clauses in purchase contracts that have contingencies for these things.\n\nReal estate attorneys cost a fraction of the $10,000+ that you were quoted. If she were to get sued, it would cost $10,000 + to defend herself however, if she can have a real estate attorney find a legal loophole, she may be able to figure it out without spending that much money.

First, a quick synopsis: My partner passed away in early 2017 after a lengthy struggle with mental illness.\nHer brother, despite not having any real contact with her during the last 7 years of her life (by her choice, not his) was present at her final moments with myself as I figured at her death bed wasn't the time to perpetuate long standing grudges and despite their issues he deserved to be there with her at the end.\n\nAfter she passed, we discussed the future and, after a discussion between the two of us, he elected to start a gofundme in her name under the pretense of raising money for the immediate assistance of myself and the our two young children that she left behind.\n\nAlthough I personally find the concept of cash for condolences to be a bit tacky and found it odd that he'd want to start immediately banging around the donation tin, I acquiesced and let him create the fund.\n\nDuring the campaign, he raised around 9 or so thousand from friends and family, as well as pocketing cash handed to him at the funeral itself (her hometown has a large Italian population and apparently that is the norm?) and from selling her vehicle, despite promising not to do so without discussion with me as he had no legal right to do so and I was her only stated next of Kin.\n\nOnce the campaign had concluded, he and I entered into discussion as to how the Money would be Used, at which point he decided that, despite previous agreements and what he had initially stated on the gofundme, that he was now going to awkwardly insert himself into our fiscal matters and put the money into a fund for the children to access when they turn 18. He then amended the gofundme page from the original intention to reflect this change, which understandably upset some of those who donated thinking it would go to help the family during the time of struggle rather than go towards some arbitrary fund for the future. \n\nDespite ostensibly being to immediately assist us with the funeral costs and the like, I agreed to the creation of a fund on the sole condition that, if he insisted on retaining some element of control regarding the fund, then we BOTH get established as signatories, so to alleviate whatever concerns he had that I wouldn't use the money in a matter that he didn't agree with and, conversely, he wouldn't be able to do the same, as both of us would need to sign for anything.\n\nHe refused to give me any signatory power, despite me pointing out that by doing so would protect the fund from anyone being able to just dip in at their convenience, and after lengthy arguments it became clear that he never had any real intention of even creating the fund, despite his claims. \n\nHe demanded to be the sole person in charge, despite having nothing to do with either myself or my children's lives up to this point, and the entire thing felt disingenuous and a way for him to try and retain power, as I couldn't see why, for both of our peace of mind, he wouldn't have myself, the children's only surviving guardian, involved in their fiscal fund at all, unless he intended to use the money for purposes other than what he was stating.\n\nLong story short, I told the cockwomble to jog on and messaged those people that I could who had donated to pull their money out while they could and to keep it for themselves, of which about 3000 was removed from the gofundme in response.\n\nHowever, with the 5000 or so left, he, promising to create a trust fund, absconded with the money and, to this day has never created any fund, particularly as he has no legal right to and doesn't even know my the dates of birth or full names of either of my children. He also, as mentioned above, sold my partners car without my permission and kept the money, despite me possessing the only title of ownership for said vehicle.\n\nDisgusted, I pursued what legal avenues were available to me, but after reporting the case to the gofundme campaign to ACORN, the Australian cybercrimes division, I, after nearly a year and a half, have received notice that the acts he committed by obtaining funds through deceptive measures, somehow doesn't constitute fraud as clear intent can't be established.\n\nIn regards to the stolen car being sold off, I reported this to local authorities and was told that, as the property was considered part of a deceased estate, my only recourse was to pursue the matter in civil court as it didn't constitute a criminal offence, despite the fact that this fucking jizz stain literally stole the vehicle and sold it for his own profit.\n\nI don't profess to know all of the intricacies of the law, indeed it's extremely convoluted, but in my eyes both acts are clearly cases of theft and profiting due to deception and fraudulent means, yet I'm basically told to eat shit and smile while I'm doing so by any law enforcement agency I've reported it to.\n\nSo, I'm curious if there is anything at all I can do or if I have been misinformed in some manner, as I frequently see people getting caught running gofundme scams yet this douchenozzle has got away with it seemingly scot free.\n\nI don't care about the money at all, but I do care about justice and feel that it hasn't been served here; basically, from what I've been told, you can create fake gofundme campaigns and sell a deceased person's property out from under their surviving next of kin without any legal ramifications, which just doesn't sound right by any conception.\n\nSo, do I have any alternate avenues in which I can approach this situation?

If I were in your shoes, I'd probably just ask my doctor to provide a letter stating that (a) the syringes are required for administering necessary prescribed medication and (b) that HIPAA prevents him from sharing any further details regarding your diagnosis or treatment.

They also said that they were waiting for Me to contact them to set up a new shipping date (which I was never told to do), and added that they could ship the furniture this week. My state just had a record high number of covid 19 cases, so as an immune compromised person I do not want to have anyone come to my home now. I told them this, and that I wished to cancel my order and get a refund instead since I never received any items after many months and was never offered a new shipping date when they originally stopped the shipment.

{"prompt":" Q: My father (78) fell out of bed the night he was admitted at a physical therapy\/nursing home in NY. He was admitted in the first place because he has brain damage from a previous fall. We saw a lot of unprofessional behavior the day we dropped him off, and I don't know what to do.\nT: GOOD\nB: Short background: My father had a stroke in 2005 and is paralyzed on the left side of his body. He can walk with assistance from a cane. A few days ago he tripped in my parent's home and hit his head, knocking himself out cold. When he woke up he was confused, not able to speak, and not following directions. He was rushed to the ER and was in the hospital's neurology wing for a few days. They did CAT scans (No MRI) and found that he didn't have a stroke or seizure, hitting his head caused some bleeding in the brain and as it cleared up he was able to speak again. He isn't 100% better, he is still confused and screwing up when talking to people. I feel he was rushed out of the hospital before he was ready to make room for another patient.\n\n He was unable to get out of bed at the hospital, so his muscles got very weak, and he is no longer able to walk unassisted, or in general. His doctors recommended physical therapy, and the day he was discharged from the hospital I, my sister, and my mother drove him to the physical therapy\/nursing home in our car (my mom couldn't afford to pay for the ambulance.) \n\nHere's where the problems start: The admissions manager at the nursing home told my mom they have strict COVID regulations in place to prevent their patients catching it (specifically every patient only works with one nurse) and all patients are placed under quarantine for 2 weeks. Once out of their quarantine the patients would have to be socially distanced, and in their rooms unless in specific communal areas. They told my mom that they hadn't had any COVID cases yet because of these safety regulations, and because they test all of their staff weekly. That all sounded great. But when we arrived we found out that this wasn't the case, and admissions was extremely unprofessional.\n\nWhen we arrived the receptionist told us she was very new. We weren't greeted by any administrators or supervisors. There were nurses walking around the ground floor but they were ignoring us and going home. The receptionist looked up my dad's room, led me and him to an elevator and told us to go up to the ward upstairs. My mom and sister would follow me in the next elevator. I got upstairs with my dad, who by that point wasn't talking much, and walked out of the elevator into the ward. There were patients in wheelchairs, some with masks on, some without, all over the place. There were nurses milling around who didn't even acknowledge that I was there.

{"prompt":" Q: My father (78) fell out of bed the night he was admitted at a physical therapy\/nursing home in NY. He was admitted in the first place because he has brain damage from a previous fall. We saw a lot of unprofessional behavior the day we dropped him off, and I don't know what to do.\nT: GOOD\nB: Short background: My father had a stroke in 2005 and is paralyzed on the left side of his body. He can walk with assistance from a cane. A few days ago he tripped in my parent's home and hit his head, knocking himself out cold. When he woke up he was confused, not able to speak, and not following directions. He was rushed to the ER and was in the hospital's neurology wing for a few days. They did CAT scans (No MRI) and found that he didn't have a stroke or seizure, hitting his head caused some bleeding in the brain and as it cleared up he was able to speak again. He isn't 100% better, he is still confused and screwing up when talking to people. I feel he was rushed out of the hospital before he was ready to make room for another patient.\n\n He was unable to get out of bed at the hospital, so his muscles got very weak, and he is no longer able to walk unassisted, or in general. His doctors recommended physical therapy, and the day he was discharged from the hospital I, my sister, and my mother drove him to the physical therapy\/nursing home in our car (my mom couldn't afford to pay for the ambulance.) \n\nHere's where the problems start: The admissions manager at the nursing home told my mom they have strict COVID regulations in place to prevent their patients catching it (specifically every patient only works with one nurse) and all patients are placed under quarantine for 2 weeks. Once out of their quarantine the patients would have to be socially distanced, and in their rooms unless in specific communal areas. They told my mom that they hadn't had any COVID cases yet because of these safety regulations, and because they test all of their staff weekly. That all sounded great. But when we arrived we found out that this wasn't the case, and admissions was extremely unprofessional.\n\nWhen we arrived the receptionist told us she was very new. We weren't greeted by any administrators or supervisors. There were nurses walking around the ground floor but they were ignoring us and going home. The receptionist looked up my dad's room, led me and him to an elevator and told us to go up to the ward upstairs. My mom and sister would follow me in the next elevator. I got upstairs with my dad, who by that point wasn't talking much, and walked out of the elevator into the ward. There were patients in wheelchairs, some with masks on, some without, all over the place. There were nurses milling around who didn't even acknowledge that I was there. No one noticed us until my mom and sister came upstairs, at which point they started to yell at us. Apparently the receptionist had allowed us into a closed ward that only patients and nurses are allowed in. They took my dad's belongings, told us a nurse would take care of him, and told us that we had to go back downstairs without him.

If the nursing home takes Medicare or Medicaid, file a report with them as well. Falls are preventable and there should have been measures in place for your father, who should have been immediately assessed as a patient at risk of falls (low bed, rails, movement alarms, pads on the floor, frequent checks etc). CMS and state department of health takes falls VERY seriously. It’s one of the metrics they use to assess quality. Also, any injury related to the fall would be the financial responsibility of the facility, so contact an attorney that can tell you your rights and make sure the hospital bills are covered. Also, I’d look into a new facility. Check the CMS website and you can search by quality measure for your area. END"}

The new pumpkin is still connected to the plant. Therefore, the new pumpkin belongs to the neighbor. \n\nThink about this. If the neighbor had, say, a basketball hoop in her yard, and the wind blew the hoop over, it’s leaning against the fence, and it’s now hanging over the fence and extending into OP’s yard. We wouldn’t dispute that the basketball hoop still belongs to OP’s neighbor even though it’s hanging over OP’s property.

So the pumpkin plant, the property of OP’s neighbor, has entered onto OP’s land. That is trespass. \n\nOP’s remedy is to ask the neighbor to remove the pumpkin, and if the neighbor fails to, then OP could remove it. OP would be on safer ground to do this with a court order, but that’s not likely to be cost effective in this scenario. \n\nThis is the same scenario as when a tree branch grows out over a neighbors yard and then the other neighbor saws the branch off and there’s a dispute or something.

I'm a white male and my wife is Hispanic. As my wife was filling out the application for our son's healthcare she didn't know which ethnicity box to check for him so she just checked \"white\". The social worker told my wife she couldn't put \"white\" because she's not white.

Secondly, what ethnicity should we put for our son in the future?\n\nI live in California.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Most of the time, questions regarding race are based on what you interpret your own race to be, otherwise a lot of people would be left wondering.

Do we have to go through the process of suing the hotel to recover any monetary compensation? \nThanks for any advice given.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Also NAL, also have motel experience.  These comments may get removed due to being considered anecdotal, but my experience was that guests do accuse housekeeping of stealing, many times these accusations are obviously false (i.e., the guest only decides they were robbed after they've been asked to leave to running naked down the corridors), and the front desk and managers have gotten to where they automatically mentally dismiss the accusations.  Offers to call the police--our manager would always offer--would almost invariably be shrugged off by the guest.  However, there were a few times when the guest persisted, the police were called, and a check of the key card reader showed that hey, someone unauthorized was in the room. END"}

To release medical records a hospital or doctor needs a signed release from the patient. These are routine in Personal Injury cases, and, even though plaintiffs are required by law to produce the records, hospitals will not send a scrap of paper until they have the release from the patient.  For a doctor's office to release records without a release to anyone, much less a third party they had been specifically warned about, is quite surprising.    \nYou should strongly consider finding a lawyer in your area to help you with this. You can file a HIPAA complaint with HHS.  A lawyer familiar with Oklahoma's privacy laws can advise you on whether you can potentially file a lawsuit, and whether the individual's actions are a crime (I don't know Oklahoma's laws on the subject, but in New York this would very much be a criminal violation of a protective\/restraining order).

Thank you for any insight!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I will start by clarifying that IANAL but I handled my parents estate. If the only thing your dad owns of value is the house, it can be handled in a few ways. Adding your names prior to his death has negative tax implications and it ties you to the debt on the property so I don't recommend it at all. It can\/will hurt your credit or ability to get loans in the future because his house debt is now your house debt. Instead he can simply leave it to you and\/or your sister in his will or you can file a transfer on death which means the minute he dies, the property transfers. This leads to the second piece of advice. Get a simple will drawn up. Most lawyers will do it for less than $500 and is important if he owns anything at all. Make a list of every possible asset he has and share that with the lawyer. \n\nSet up a medical power of attorney also. The POA you already set up doesn't cover medical. These are standard documents and can be downloaded from the internet, filled out, and signed. You can also get them from the hospital or your doctors office typically. \n\nIf he has bank accounts, you can file papers with the bank that once he passes, they will transfer to you. Do not put your name on the accounts because it could tie you to his debt if he dies and is not financially on the positive side.\n\nIf he has a car, the DMV should have paperwork available to also have it transfer on death. Again, don't add your name to the title because then it is a liability to you. If he hits someone or something while driving, you are liable and it can also hurt your credit. \n\nBest of luck to you and if you have more questions, feel free to ask. END"}

Code 89-8-13 provides that you may seek to terminate the lease in the event of a material noncompliance with the lease agreement by the landlord. This states that you need to give 14 days written notice to the landlord describing the breach and that the lease will terminate not was than 14 days after the date of the notice if the breach is not remedied. If they do remedy it, the lease will not terminate. Given this isn’t a typical breach such as failure to repair or something like that, it isn’t clear if there is a way they could properly “remedy” this, aside from making you feel comfortable that it wouldn’t happen again. \n\nIn the event they remedy it, 89-8-13(3)(b) states that if it happens again within 6 months, you can terminate wit 14 days notice regardless of their attempts to remedy. If the agreement is terminated, subsection (4) provides that the landlord shall return all prepaid and unearned rent as well as the security deposit recoverable by the tenant. \n\nSo if you do want out, it may be worth consulting a lawyer as this is both a breach of the lease agreement and arguably the covenant of quiet enjoyment and there is no requirement in the statute that the landlord breach multiple times.

{"prompt":" Q: Guy on the next street landed his drone in my yard, my dog ruined it. He wants me to file a claim with my homeowner's insurance.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi all, Iowa state question for you:\n\nLast week someone who lives a street over from me was testing out his new drone. He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.\n\nBy this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog \"vicious\" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.\n\nHe came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.\n\nThis morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because \"dog damaged property\" has a pretty nasty ring to it.  Thanks to the fact that the drone was literally carrying a camera we know our dog wasn't chewing on it or anything, but I don't want a record on our homeowner's insurance that implies we have a dangerous dog - hell maybe by insurance standards she IS dangerous for this, but I'm very leery of it.\n\nObviously I understand that if our dog bites someone on our property that is a problem and we are liable - but is there anything legal that dictates fault if someone lands a drone on our property? Not surprisingly Google is failing me here.  We are debating whether to try and come to an agreement with him or if we should tell him to kick rocks. Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Commercial drone pilot here, I'd tell him to beat it. \n\nIf you feel so inclined to give him an actual response, FAA guidelines for sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft Systems) are pretty strict on what you can and can't do...\n\nFirst step is to inquire if his drone is registered with the FAA. \n\nThen check to see if he broke any of these guidelines:\n - are you within 5 miles of an airport? Did he receive permission from the airport to fly?\n - did he fly over any people or moving vehicles?\n - did he fly beyond his visual line of sight of the drone? (Not knowing if the camera was attached would indicate yes)\n - was he flying at night? \n - was he operating commercially? If yes, does he have a Part 107?\n - finally, was he operating in a \"careless or reckless manner?\"\n\nIf any of these were even slightly amiss, you can threaten call the local FAA Flight Standards District Office, and they can handle a legit aircraft complaint. \n\nAs someone who has operated drones commercially with many hours of flight time, he is completely in the wrong. He didn't properly secure the landing site, which is entirely on him as the pilot. Your dog was confined to your property, in a safe manner with proper protections in place. \n\nThis is like me jumping your fence to rob you, and then complaining when the dog bites me. If it gets as far as a civil suit, any decent judge will throw that out in a heartbeat.\n\n\nEDIT: just scrolled up and read the part about \"BUSINESS insurance\"... If this happened while the guy was operating commercially, then PLEASE report it to the FAA. Your local FSDO can roast this guy alive. Those guidelines I mentioned turn into hard rules you must follow, or lose your flying privileges. \n\nAlso... Jokes on him for using commercial insurance and not getting the drone covered. (free advice here folks, if you're gonna fly professionally, get the insurance. I've got $5 million on my fleet.) END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Guy on the next street landed his drone in my yard, my dog ruined it. He wants me to file a claim with my homeowner's insurance.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi all, Iowa state question for you:\n\nLast week someone who lives a street over from me was testing out his new drone. He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.\n\nBy this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog \"vicious\" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.\n\nHe came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.\n\nThis morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because \"dog damaged property\" has a pretty nasty ring to it.  Thanks to the fact that the drone was literally carrying a camera we know our dog wasn't chewing on it or anything, but I don't want a record on our homeowner's insurance that implies we have a dangerous dog - hell maybe by insurance standards she IS dangerous for this, but I'm very leery of it.\n\nObviously I understand that if our dog bites someone on our property that is a problem and we are liable - but is there anything legal that dictates fault if someone lands a drone on our property? Not surprisingly Google is failing me here.  We are debating whether to try and come to an agreement with him or if we should tell him to kick rocks. Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When his drone landed on your property, it becomes property \"accidentally or inadvertently thrown, fallen, blown, or\nstrays onto private property\".

There is a doctrine of scrivener's error (when there is some error in the written contract and there is clear evidence that it does not match what both parties agreed to orally). But it sounds the OP and the landlord agreed on a renewal with only the OP on the lease, with a separate understanding that the lease could be modified in the future to include the other roommates. The fact is that A and B signed no contract with anyone. If A and B's names were not on the lease it's basically impossible for OP to say that he thought he was signing a document with A and B's names on it. OP should not have signed the lease until the issue was resolved. \n\nIt's also probably a moot point, because rental agreements like this almost always state joint and several liability meaning the landlord can go after the roommates as a group or each individual roommate for the full amount. So even if B had signed, the landlord can ask OP for the full amount. OP and B have no actual contractual obligation to each other. To protect themselves, OP, A and B should have asked for separate leases, or they should have made a contract with each other regarding who was responsible for the full amount. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Leasing office fumbled leaseholder paperwork\nT: BAD\nB: Location: Jersey City, NJ \n\nSummary: Leasing office did not process paperwork correctly, leaving me as the sole leaseholder and accountable party of a 3BR apartment. Roommate has taken advantage of the legal situation and left the apartment without finding a replacement, leaving us to compensate for his rent.\n\nIn March 2019, my two roommates (A and B) and I signed a lease renewal for our 3BR apartment. A and B joined mid-lease 2019, and were only occupants at this time, not leaseholders. I was the only leaseholder at this time because I was there during the signing of the original lease in 2018. Both roommates were aligned with the lease renewal and expressed long term interest in the apartment. This was right before the virus began to gain speed.\n\nWe wanted to add them as leaseholders before signing the renewal but could not, as the office said that the previous roommates had to be removed from the lease, before adding A and B. After accepting this, I signed and we left that meeting, and contacted my previous roommates. We learned the previous roommates had submitted their lease removal forms last year and it was already processed. I was already the only leaseholder during the time of this signing, and we could have added A and B during the resigning meeting.\n\nTo formalize A and B as leaseholders, we prepared the necessary forms ASAP. However, the office was already closed and we could not submit the forms in-person. We called the office and were instructed to send the representative the forms via email instead. We emailed the forms to the office on the same day. We followed up multiple times with no confirmation that A and B were added to the lease.\n\nWe would not have signed the lease renewal, if we knew that A and B would not be added to the lease. It's a professional courtesy and expectation of the leasing office to acknowledge our application -- either by accepting, or explaining what was missing, which we were willing to immediately address.\n\nBecause B was not added to the lease, he has now taken advantage of the situation.

What was in question was whether he thought he was signing a lease with his old roommates on it, let's call them X and Y. Probably doesn't make a difference to the outcome if you're correct that it's joint and severable, but what the leasing office did seems very shady. They kept A and B off the lease because X and Y were supposedly already on the lease with OP. To say that A and B can't sign the new lease because X and Y are current leaseholders implies that the leasing office is saying OP isn't the only one on the hook.\n\nLeasing office lied to him saying he had a lease with X and Y, then stonewalled him when he found out the truth and tried to add A and B.

{"prompt":" Q: Doctor won't sign my STD form\nT: BAD\nB: (Lakewood, Colorado USA)Background: starting in June of 2019, I was diagnosed with a DTV (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and PE (Pulmonary Embolism). I've had 4 stays in the hospital. My Short Term Disability kicks in after 2 weeks of missed work, so I have to fill out a 3 page form for every hospital stay- 1 page for me, 1 page for my employer,  1 page for the doctor I followed up with post hospital stay. After my second hospitalization,  I was referred to follow up with a hematologist,  so, I have to have him sign one of the forms. His office has had the form for a month, he's refused to sign it multiple times based on issues he's had that I was able to clarify, and at this point I can't even get a call back from the office.

{"prompt":" Q: HOA vs. Neighborhood Association (MI)\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Michigan. I recently received a visit from the president of our neighborhood group about my yard. We have a couple signs up, which are apparently not allowed under the rules. He told me he had received a complaint. We had also been looking into building a fence soon, which he said is also against the rules. This visit is the first step in rule enforcement.\n\nHere's the thing: A number of people in our neighborhood insist that we have a neighborhood association and not an HOA, and thus it is voluntary and they have no power to enforce the rules (including someone on the board). They say only one new phase of our neighborhood has an HOA and it is a completely different organization because it is only now being built 60 years later (that is another story). I asked the president whether our organization was voluntary or not, he gave me a non-answer. I asked him what the penalties were if we failed to comply and he said they could not put a lien on the house, but the next step if we didn't resolve it would be to get lawyers involved. I know that at least 1\/3 of the residents don't pay dues, many people of signs (political or otherwise) and there are other rule violations all over (e.g., storing boats or trailers).\n\nWhen we moved in, we were told by the previous owners that this was an HOA and we signed something as part of our closing saying it was mandatory with annual dues, which we paid last year under that impression. This paper was not from the association, it was from the sellers as a disclosure. Those folks didn't live here long so I would not be surprised if they were misled.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How can I be sure whether this is an HOA or a voluntary neighborhood association?\n2. If it is voluntary, did the \"mandatory\" paper or paying dues lock us in forever somehow?\n3. If it is voluntary, am I within my rights to ignore the rules?\n4. Does the selective enforcement matter? I doubt we're being discriminated against in any illegal way, I think we just have a neighbor that dislikes us that complained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to add info:\n\nAt this point, I doubt anyone will see these edits, but I did some digging. In MI, HOAs have to file with the state and file annual reports. The earliest available was 2007, in which the organization described itself as a neighborhood association. In 2009, it began referring to itself as a homeowner's association. I contacted the county and there are no deed restrictions related to an HOA, just public utility easements. At this point I am worried that the seller's addendum could lock us in somehow to this seemingly non-HOA that presents itself as an HOA.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. If it is a HOA it must have written bylaws which will detail an annual meeting, how board members are chosen, your appeal process, etc. Lack of that you don't have one.\n\n2. If it is voluntary, I would assume it is just that, voluntary, but I have no experience in this particular question.\n\n3. I would think you could just ignore it\n\n4. Selective enforcement matters a lot. We had this issue in an HOA i was a resident of in Michigan. The previous board had ignored most of the bylaws. When the new board tried to enforce rules, many residents threatened to sue. The HOA hired an attorney who advised us we needed to \"grandfather\" in anyone who was allowed rule infractions without consequence or any future attempts to enforce would be thrown out.\n\nI have served on HOA boards and was a past president of the neighborhood HOA I lived in. The rules are very specific in Michigan and the boards cannot run their own little kingdoms. I would demand, in writing, a copy of the bylaws. If they don't exist, I would ask where they believe they receive their authority. I can't imagine a situation where your town or county would support any enforcement without bylaws in place. There must be a written process that is ALWAYS followed for rule infractions, otherwise they have no legal standing to enforce against you. As a side note, in an actual HOA, at closing you sign a form that says you have received the bylaws and agree to their contents. Without that i am not sure how you could have a legal and enforceable HOA.\n\nI am not an attorney, but play one on the internet.

The only thing I would add is to be very clear who this guy represents  (HOA vs. Neighborhood Assoc), and that he in fact is their representative.  To be an HOA president, as u\/Justahotdadbod alluded to, you have to be elected according to the HOA rules, and he can't just be saying, \"I'll do it, if no one else will.\"  Those rules will spell out the conditions upon which you can be elected, and there are probably requirements and restrictions like term limits, the existence of a quorum, etc.  Verify this person is who he says he is.\n\nAlso, its a good idea to go to your HOA meetings fairly frequently.  Helping keep your HOA on the right track pays off in the long run, and you end up knowing who's who. END"}

It's not something I agree with and it's unfair to workers, especially when they're put in a position where they are never really free to enjoy their time off, but it's the decision federal court has upheld.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/tools-and-samples\/hr-qa\/pages\/cms_020208.aspx\n\nGenerally, it seems like the biggest difference between engaged to wait and waiting to be engaged are whether you're required to remain within a certain proximity of the job site.\n\nEdit: However, OP may still qualify as engaged to wait depending on the frequency and amount of phone calls they are answering.  For example, if they only have half an hour to an hour between phone calls, they could make an argument that that they are not free to enjoy that time and are engaged to wait.  On the other hand, if they only typically receive one phone call a night, the rest of their time could be waiting to be engaged.

Pro-tip for making demands of an institution: include EVERYTHING you could possibly want, as so to make the more reasonable things (like sick time off and mask requirements) a low hanging fruit for them. They’ll feel like they got out of having to give you double pay, and you’ll have gotten everything you actually wanted (and maybe more!). \n\nWhat they’re asking for isn’t necessarily unreasonable: they just don’t want you to sue them if you get covid-19 and get really sick\/end up with medical debt. That would be pretty hard anyways because you would have to prove you got sick because of the school.

Last week, by text, she made the claim that there was no will and has not responded to any of our messages since. We are all very skeptical about this claim and are worried that she may be hiding the will against our father’s last wishes. We are suspicious for a few reasons:\n\n1. He called my sister in 2018 stating that he was making her co-executor of his will and that he wanted to leave money for us.\n\n2. He was a very organized and intelligent man, so the idea of him not organizing a will at any point either before or after his second marriage is shocking.\n\nThe problem is that we do not have the name of his attorney or a copy of the will. We also do not know if a will was filed with his death certificate, or if this lawyer was notified about his death. \n\nUltimately we are wondering if this case is worth pursuing legally, and if there is a way to locate his lawyer without having to contact our stepmother?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sorry for your loss\n\nYou can cold call lawyers he might have used. If you can't find the will, you and your siblings would split 50% of his estate END"}

He gifted her the money on the pretense that his bank account had been compromised and that he was moving the money into hers for safe keeping. His family has not asked for the money back outright, but they are pressuring her into giving it to them to pay for funeral services, among other things.

And it's not a gift causa mortis for the same reason\/ in addition, most state statutes defining a gift causa mortis require death to be an external event. Georgia says, \"must be in his last illness or in peril of death;\". So it's debatable whether such a transfer would be upheld as a gift. It's likely that the money will be found to be part of her estate. Finally, as a baliee of that money, she may have extra duties or liability if she fails to return it. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: My (US) bank gave me Canadian money, and won't take it back.\nT: GOOD\nB: It's as weird as it sounds. I live in a building with coin operated laundry, so I've been having a tough time getting laundry done lately with the US coin shortage. On Monday I gave it another go, and stood in line at the bank for about an hour. They told me there was a one-per-customer limit on the quarter rolls, so I gave them my $10 bill and went home with a roll. After struggling trying to get the washing machine to accept the quarters - I realized more than half of them were Canadian coins! For anyone who doesn't know, the Canadian 25 cent coins are the same color, size and shape as American quarters, but coin machines won't take them.\n\nI went back to the bank, waited in line again, and explained my situation to the teller - who told me that there was \"no proof\" I had purchased the coins from the bank (to be fair I definitely didn't ask for a receipt for purchasing a roll of quarters), and said they weren't allowed to give me replacement quarters. I paid in cash so there's no record of the purchase on my bank card.\n\nI realize there probably is no available course of action outside of complaining about it to the bank; I'm just upset I basically threw my money away (and still can't do laundry lol). Any ideas?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" They can't give you replacement quarters (even if you did use your debit card), but you can do a currency exchange. It's a long transaction and, with the exchange rate, you'll only get back 19 cents (as of today) per Canadian quarter, BUT you'll get money back AND make the teller go through a long, PITA transaction for an absolutely petty amount of money.\n\nBefore you do that, I would also see if you can speak with the branch manager about the issue, but frame it in a \"this is just so weird, but you may want to give the central vault a head's up that their coin machine is not catching Canadian quarters\" way. They may just make it right for you. If they don't, then file the formal complaint and do the currency exchange.\n\nHaving worked as a bank teller, I can think of 2 ways this would have happened.\n\n* Less likely: the central vault for your bank in your area let the CA quarters slip through\n* More likely: another bank customer rolled their coins at home (either not catching the foreign coins or putting them in deliberately) and deposited them. With the coin shortage, the branch is not able to send as many coins as they normally would, so when this person deposited coins, they were immediately used by the tellers without sending to the vault first for verification. This is against protocol, but when there is a shortage, the branch will use whatever it can to get through the day.\n\n\\*Edit: foreign currency exchange is highly bank specific. Some have minimum amounts, some will not accept coins, some have certain branches that are handle foreign currency,, and some don't deal with it at all. Check with your bank to see if they will exchange foreign coins for US dollars. END"}

LL claims he had 21 days from June 30th, but I moved out 10 days earlier and even saw him that day, he saw me leave in a huge truck (he actually tried to have my moving truck towed, which cost me $150), I told him keys were on the counter and that I wouldn't be back.\n\nAs far as the charges, all of them are estimates, no actual damages or receipts. $10k is from a contractor estimate, $3k is for a month's rent (he says work will take 4 weeks), and then $2k in various BS charges.... going to list them now.\n\n1. He has quote for brand new granite\/quartz countertops, because of a small chip size of dime in the cheap laminate countertop I had. There were already 4 other similarly sized chips in the countertop when I moved in.\n2. In quote there is a brand new stainless steel sink and plumbing for sink, because of a 1mm x 4mm chip in the ceramic sink. (chip happened when cleaning a pan that slipped)\n3. Brand new high end gas stove, because there is some carbon buildup on the cheap stove I had that was impossible to clean. It worked fine but it was stained even before I moved in (though it did get worse over 7 years).\n4. Brand new high end dishwasher. He claims my (shitty and old) dishwasher is \"noisy and not draining\", which is true and I've complained about it. Isn't that his responsibility?\n5. He wants $400 for \"custom drapes\" which were shitty drapes cut from discount material he did himself. A few years into tenancy he demanded I clean his drapes and didn't give care instructions, so I washed them on cold and they shrank.... he wants the $400 because they shrank\n6. He wants $250 for not returning keys when he only gave me one set, and I returned two sets (I had a backup). I don't know when he's even talking about. \n7. He wants $250 for a broken toilet valve. My toilet didn't work last couple weeks of tenancy because the valve was an old compression valve that O-Ring wore out so it wouldn't provide any water to toilet, but he is saying I damaged it.\n8. $190 for cleaning, when I left the place cleaner than I found it (and have photos to prove)\n9. Couple other random bogus stuff\n\n\nI'd like to sue him in small claims for the return of my $1k security deposit + double damages ($3k total) because he refused to do the pre-move out inspection and took more than 21 days to respond, and only included estimates not charges. Does anyone know what's going on with small claims court in SF \/ CA??? Are they even doing it with Covid stuff?\n\nWhat do I do about this demand for 14k???\n\nI'd really like to handle this myself and make him pay, but if he gets even 10% of these bogus charges it'll cost me more than the security deposit. I don't know what to do.\n\nDoes anyone know how I should approach this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" https:\/\/www.tobenerlaw.com\/san-francisco-renters-rights\/\n\nWare and Tare\n\n&gt; Wear and Tear\nMost disputes over security deposits come down to what constitutes “normal wear and tear.” When a tenant moves out of a unit, the landlord may deduct from a tenant’s security deposit to repair damage to the premises that is caused by the tenant, but only for damage beyond wear and tear. A tenant should understand at the beginning of their tenancy what exactly is be considered “ordinary wear and tear.”\n\nSecurity Deposit\n\n&gt;Tenants should do a pre-move in and a pre-move out inspection of the premises. The landlord can deduct from the security for “ordinary wear and tear” but must account for those deductions in writing. Additionally, the tenant is entitled to the return of their security deposit twenty-one (21) days after they move out. If a landlord withholds a tenant’s security deposit in bad faith, they may be liable for the amount of the deposit and up to twice the amount of the deposit. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Someone stole a ghost pepper off my balcony that had pesticide on it. Am I liable if they get sick?\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Texas. I have a ghost pepper plant that I'm growing for fun on my balcony, with no intention of eating it, so I just sprayed it with a random pesticide I had laying around the house. This morning, one of the peppers is missing and obviously torn off from the stem. Now I'm worried whoever stole it could get sick since I didn't check if the pesticide is safe for consumption. Would I be at all liable? And could I put a sign up that says they aren't safe to eat?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not saying it's any better but could it have been an animal (squirrel, bird, etc) that took the pepper?  I believe birds don't have a taste receptor for spicy things hence how pepper plants are able to spread via their poop. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Great Uncle has installed a metal door and possibly listening devices in great-grandmother's home (among many other things). What can I do to help her?\nT: GOOD\nB: I can't even believe that this is a story I'm currently living through because it is that insane. At this point, I fear for my family member's lives and my great-grandmother's wellbeing. \n\nHere is the main point we are at right now:\nMy great uncle (great-grandmother's son), let's call him Paul. Paul has come home to Pennsylvania from Florida to visit, along with his wife and her children. While here, he threw away an unknown amount of items from her house, possibly took items home, and installed a huge metal door with fencing around it (imagine the metal doors that stores in bad neighborhoods use to close up at night) at the top of her stairs which lead to the attic. In the attic is his childhood room, which previously held 0 possessions of his. There is also a second bedroom and attic area full of my great-grandmother's items, such as winter clothing, home decor, christmas decor, painting supplies, and way more. She is now unable to access them.\n \nThis door was installed WITHOUT My great-grandmother knowing and without her approval. I am unsure if she approved him to get rid of or take any items. My brother believes he found a listening device in the home but that is not confirmed. I would not be surprised if Paul is listening and waiting to fly back at any moment.\n\nA little more background:\nMy brother has been staying at my my great-grandmother's home nightly for the past couple months. Her husband passed recently and it was more so she could have company. He stayed in what used to be Paul's childhood bedroom. Paul and his wife stay in that room when they visit, so my brother cleaned it out but still had some of his clothes, a TV, an Xbox, and money in the room. This was all put away and shouldn't have hindered on their stay. \n\nThis infuriated Paul. He threw my brother's items down the stairs. Told him to get everything and leave. Told him he is not welcome on the property ever again. He has gotten in his face screaming. We do not know why to this day. My brother is 18 and is beyond beside himself. He has been bawling and trying to figure out what he did wrong. \n\nMy brother's girlfriend has also being staying in the home, with permission from my great-grandmother and her own family. Together, they have been helping my great-grandmother clean, cook, and keeping her company. \n\nOn the night that Paul told them to get their stuff and leave, my brother and his girlfriend both went to the house to do just that. While there, Paul's wife grabbed a hold of my brother's girlfriend by the back of the neck. She said, and I quote, \"Come here little bitch. Paul, do you want to see me beat a little girl's ass?\" This occurred in front of my great-grandmother and the wife's children. My brother's girlfriend did not retaliate, she got away and went outside. She had done nothing prior and only said \"I'm going to get my stuff and am leaving.\" \n\nPaul told my brother he is not allowed to step foot on the property. And if he does, he will find out and he will do something about it. I believe the exact words were \"there will be to hell to pay.\" Paul does not own the home, the land, or anything. It will not even be left to him in the will because it is now owned by the bank. \n\nThere is more that has occurred, but these are the major items. During all of this, my great-grandmother sat back and watched. She never asked Paul and his family to leave. I believe she is too afraid to do anything about it, but she has not admitted that. \n\nSome background on Paul:\nEx-army, ex-policeman, teaches gun classes, always carries. He has killed people (in war and as a police officer) There is a lot of bad family history as well. He is scary. My family does not visit our great-grandmother when he is here because we are afraid of him. I do not put physical harm or shooting us past him. \n\n\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I can't help because my great-grandmother isn't taking any action. I would love to know if there is something I can do to help her, to make him not be able to come back here. My family is afraid to go to the cops because my brother has been in some (minor) trouble in the past. I keep saying that doesn' tmatter but they are against it. Paul's wife is \"sue happy\" and would instantly try to make a case against us. And paul is very knowledgeable (or seems to be) in the legal system that I want to make sure my I's are dotted and T's are crossed before I do anything. \n\nI'm so worried and so afraid. Any advice is beyond appreciated. I will provide more info if needed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This sounds like a few issues going on.  Kicking out your brother was potentially an illegal eviction .  Threatening your brother is a potential police issue.  Taking advantage of your great-grandmother is potential elder abuse and theft.\n\nHow sound-of-mind is your great-grandmother?  Some of these behaviors (adding a locked door so Paul could have an apartment) are potentially okay if your great-grandmother is okay with it and competent to make that decision, but it sure seems like a red flag for potential elder abuse.\n\nI would recommend contacting Adult Protective Services and the police.  DO NOT deal with Paul directly anymore.  Things like contacting APS and the police or getting yourself a lawyer isn't going to open you up to legal liability. END"}

Even if your brother was staying there as a squatter without permission, he would still usually have tenancy protections (depends a bit on the state).  Though I'm assuming he had permission.  Even without rent\/rental agreement\/etc, he is still considered under to the law to be a tenant.\n\nIf your brother was living there for a chunk of time (depends on the state), to force him to move out requires a formal eviction, which requires a court order and then the police come to remove the person if he still refused to leave.  At no point would the owner or Paul be allowed to physically throw out someone that is living there.  Even just restricting access to the house by changing the locks or something would constitute an illegal eviction.\n\nHer being of sound mind probably changes the outcome a bit, but I would still recommend contacting adult protective services and the police even if only to get their advice and feedback.

The week that this post was about some days I was work 13 to 15 hour shifts with no break, is that legal? A lot of people are saying that I should be making 1.5x min wage. For my instance is that 1.5 x $8.23? Or is it 1.5 x $11 (state min wage)? what sort of evidence should I be collecting? We do everything electronically at my job. Is it worth it to pursue this legally?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm assuming his boss would claim the tip credit for waitstaff. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: How can I get off a joint bank account shared with my adopted daughter? (Illinois, USA)\nT: GOOD\nB: We adopted our daughter from the Illinois foster system when she was 16.  She was not a US citizen (but did have a green card).  In order to help her attain citizenship we opened a joint savings account  with a regional bank right after the adoption.\n\nAfter she turned 18 she drained her account and left without notice.  We assume that she is seeking out her birth family, but she isn't talking to us and we don't know what's going on in her life.\n\nWhat we do know is that she's draining her savings account of any money put into it, and the bank keeps applying penalties because she is below the $200 minimum.  We put in a little money to cover the penalties, but then she'll find out and withdraw it.  If the balance goes below $0 the penalties are much higher, and we don't want to be on the hook for them.\n\nWe want off the account.  The bank has stated that we cannot be removed unless she approves it, so we feel like we're being held hostage financially.  She is the primary and we are secondaries.\n\nIs there any way for us to be removed from the account?  What happens if the balance goes below $0?  Can they take the money from our other accounts?  Can we be reported to a credit agency if we move our other accounts and the joint account has a negative balance for too long?  \n\n\nEDI  They also stated that we cannot close the account; she has to.\n\ntl;dr:  18 year-old daughter left, but keeps creating a negative balance in joint account that's in her name.  We want to be taken off her account so we're not responsible for fees and penalties, but the bank says we can't without her permission.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" escalate with the bank. **also**, file a CFPB complaint. since one account holder is continuously OD'ing the account a racking up fees and you're trying to take action to prevent further potential losses, them preventing you from closing could be seen as unfair\/predatory and therefore a UDAP problem. \n\nCFPB will not act on your behalf to make the bank take some specific action on your behalf, but a CFPB complaint will be routed to the bank for review and resolution and will go right past the front line reps that you've been talking to. it'll be treated as a regulatory complaint that they'll jump through hoops to resolve where possible. you can also file a complaint with whatever govt body regulates banks in your state; same as CFPB, where it's a way to get attention focused on your issue.\n\ngood luck!

No lawyer is required. It's likely a net loss, as you'd likely have to do follow-up work to ensure you actually get paid, and especially as the value of an old dog is pretty close to zero.\n\nCriminally: you can file a police report. If there's evidence the poisoning was deliberate, the neighbours might be cited for animal cruelty. Similarly, if there's an ongoing problem with them dumping trash on your yard, your local police might be willing to cite them for littering.\n\nI'm sorry your dog died needlessly. If you feel you can no longer live with your neighbours, I understand: while the _value_ of a pet is often low, pets can be emotionally and personally very important. You might want to ask around for a referral to a good real estate agent and some movers, rather than a lawyer, as you have no meaningful option to force them to leave. END"}

I promise you that I'm not saying anything here with even a hint of malice or judgement behind it, but I think you could benefit from some perspective here. The outcome you're looking for is to have a family move out of your neighborhood because they have a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder who has caused problems and now killed your dog. There's really no legal avenue that includes forcing people to move outside of some very specific situations that don't apply here. The fact of the matter is that people have a right to have a home, even if they're shitty neighbors. The most you can really hope for is the child being placed in a residential treatment facility, but you're really not in a position to influence that at all. The most you can do is call CPS, but I can almost guarantee you that somebody at the child's school is aware of his baseline functioning, and he's either not a candidate for inpatient treatment, or he is but there's not a bed available. \n\nI'm a dog owner and mental health professional.

WTF.\n\nThen this whole pandemic outbreak begins- important detail.\n\nSuddenly, while she's waiting to receive a date to receive her implants, she gets a call from a brand new clerk at this guys brand new dental clinic. This clerk states that she owes another $2,600 (now she's stating $6,500) when she has already paid $32,000 lol. She was the recipient of a grant and paid out of pocket in the first two years.

Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something?

She has always contacted him via personal cell phone and has even had appointments off the books, like when the first office would be closed for the day, just so she could get the care she needed.\n\nYesterday her temporary bridge broke, which is a huge problem if it falls out of her mouth because she will be unable to eat or even speak. So, she texts her dentist this morning letting him know it broke and asks when she will be able to receive her permanents. He beats around the bush, claims he needs to install new temporaries instead of the permanents he claims to have with him, and states that she needs to COME IN, IN PERSON to discuss this \"cordially\" with the front desk clerk what she \"owes\" stating that \"he's just a contracted dentist and not aware of finances.\" Discuss what? Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something? This is, based on confirmed totals via bills, grants, receipts, etc. pretty clear that this is extortion.\n\nImportant points:\n\n\\-according to a previous employee of his, 7 other people are dealing with this. Unfinished services that were paid IN FULL.\n\n\\-his reviews on BBB also contain a multitude of people claiming he has done this to them as well.\n\n\\-there is zero proof that she actually owes money. no signed documents.\n\n\\-both he and his new clerk have repeatedly requested for her to come in, in person instead of discussing this via phone, email, etc.\n\n-both previous offices have confirmed that there was zero balance remaining.\n\n-the 2nd location has stated they had to stop allowing him to bring old patients in for unfinished work because it was having a financially negative effect on the company considering their services were already paid in full; therefore taking up appointment times for currently paying clients.\n\nIf you're reading this thank you so much for your time. Please help. We have some leads as far as lawyers go, however, we don't have one yet and not even sure how to handle it when we do. Any advice is welcome. Edit: updated “important points” as they develop\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ok. Good luck. END"}

She’s moved in to my house and some of her stuff was put in garbage bags on the curb so we got some of her stuff back, just clothing and a few small items like teddy bears and stuff.  But all of her valuables such as jewelry, shoes, and anything that she was given as a gift for Christmas or birthdays was kept.  This includes all her money.  The family used the same bank so her grandparents she lived with had access. They had gifted her $3,500 as a graduation present but withdrew the money claiming it was a gift from them so they can tale it back. Is there anything we can do to try and get her valuables and or money back?  We are kinda broke so we can’t afford to fight it in court.\n\nAlso she is locked out of 90% of her accounts because they kept her phone and those phone verification codes go to that number.  They haven’t canceled the phone because they are using it to call people and pretend they are her to ruin her reputation with family and friends.

She must call the police. Don't bring the backstory up. Make it as simple as possible: my grandmother locked me out of my house, stole my jewelry and clothes, and stole all of the money from my bank account.\n\n3. Let her contact list know what happened.\n\n4. She can sue them for wrongful eviction, defamation and conversion. The state in which you live changes the amount you can get back significantly. In California, she could sue for triple what was stolen from her, per Penal Code section 496 subd. (c), and one hundred dollars per day, see Civil Code section 789.3. You can also seek a prejudgment writ of possession\/writ of replevin (again depending on state) for her jewelry and other things. I would personally sue in limited jurisdiction with a fee waiver (again assuming California), rather than small claims, because it is much more procedurally difficult to defend a limited jurisdiction case, if they try to defend themselves without a lawyer you can probably win by default by just slamming them with requests for admission and then moving for summary judgment, and you have the right to a jury trial and appeals. YMMV, again, depending on your state. END"}

Do I have any course of action?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" &gt; Do I have any course of action?\n\nMaking a complaint to various banking regulators is pretty much the extent of your possible actions. (Technically, you could sue or threaten to sue the bank, but there is roughly 0% chance that is going to be useful.)\n\nFrom many of the comments you have made, you are expecting that they should not have placed a hold on the money because it was an \"on us\" check -- a check from the same institution. There ARE fairly recent banking regulations that control \"on us\" checks[1], but they guarantee next-day availability not same day cashing of the check. If your father had not had an account (which he did -- as a joint with you) they would not have been able to hold money from the account. If your father had simply deposited the money then returned the next day to withdraw it they would have had to make it available (but still could collect from your checking or savings account LATER if the check turned out to be bad). But cashing it as he did I believe they are entitled to hold the money (make it unavailable for withdrawal).\n\nThe next question is how long they are allowed to hold the money for. Here, the times you have been hearing from the bank sound normal. Most are resolved within a few business days; some cases take as long as 10 days.\n\nWhen this is all over, you may want to consider removing your father from the account if you do not have a reason to want him as a joint on it.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/regulations\/compliance\/manual\/6\/vi-1.1.pdf END"}

There’s no requirement that they treat it as a conversion\/cashing rather than a deposit. \n \nThe key here is that the check transaction was treated as a deposit. Checks don’t clear immediately, regardless of where the account is. The bank can likely chose to honor it immediately - but fake check scams are popular enough that tellers are trained to try and help their customers. \n \nThen there was a separate withdrawal of $2000 cash against your account and processed immediately. \n \nAsk your dad for the cash, then pay him when the bank credits your account.\n \nChecks shouldn’t be considered immediate instruments.

{"prompt":" Q: Neighbors are threatening legal action for a mysterious smell. Help!\nT: GOOD\nB: First, I rent in a multiunit home.  My neighbors own the home adjacent to our building.  I have lived here for 6 years and gotten along well with them for the most part.  They have complained several times over the last few months about a smell that is so offensive it burns their eyes and aggravates their asthma.  The thing is, no one in our building smells it.  They have accused me specifically as being the cause of it but I have no idea what it could be.  I used to burn incense, candles, and occasionally smoke weed (its decriminalized where I live and available medically but I don’t smoke often enough to want to get a card) but haven’t done so since the complaints started.  Additionally, my landlord has removed the exhaust fan in my bathroom thinking that could be the culprit and has installed a new one in my kitchen but still the complaints come.  I’ve even received calls about it when not home.  They have gotten desperate and angry enough to begin threatening legal recourse and possibly have me evicted.  No one in my building has complained, or even seems to smell it, and we have attempted to work with them but to no avail.  Should I be worried?  What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" They definitely are just thinking you and smell because of past occurrences. Unfortunately your willingness and politeness in the past has no bearing in this situation with the neighbors. Your landlord should handle this from here on out especially if they are spending money to try and fix the issue. I'd have your landlord ask them if they have had their plumbing checked or their home inspected for animal infestation. END"}

If you report it to CPS, they may investigate it. I say may because I'm not sure it rises to the level of CPS intervention yet. When they investigate it, they will open a file on you, your mother, your mom's boyfriend, and your dad if he's still in the picture. If they feel the need to intervene but not enough to remove you, all will have to go through a safety plan together. That could mean all sorts of things, typically it's you all using whatever resources CPS has in your area, that could be workshops, programs, therapy, etc. If they feel removal is necessary, you will be taken out of your mother's house, your parents will become defendants in a suit brought by CPS where they allege you've been neglected\/abused by your parents and you all will have to go through whatever reunification program CPS sets up for you. Yes, reunification, because that's the ultimate goal of CPS, to reunify the family. With you being 17 you may never even get to complete that program because CPS doesn't have jurisdiction over adult children. If you you have any siblings in the home, they could be affected as well. If CPS gets involved and wants to to take action, you all no longer have any control over what happens. You may not get placed with the family member you'd like to live with. You and your parents may have to do things you feel aren't necessary. You aren't guaranteed the same lifestyle you're currently living in. \n\nI'm not going to tell you CPS is bad option. If you feel you're in immediate danger, it is an option you can take to protect you, but it's an option you have no control over. If you feel like your mother has sufficiently handled it and you don't want the possibility of the above to happen, then maybe that's as far as you need to take it.\n\nEdit: Some of you need to slow your roll. Stop telling OP that this guy is definitely going to escalate things. You don't know that. You can't predict the future. Stop feeding the fear. Also, stop telling OP that she absolutely has to tell the police and CPS. She doesn't. It's her life. You don't get to dictate that. She'll have to deal with all that entails going to those authorities, not you. END"}

Hitmen aren't exactly something you can post on yahoo answers \"how do I hire a hitman\" and get an accurate answer.

Nothing the landlord can do; whether your sublease on the property is legal or not, you leased the property from the current tenant and are therefore now a tenant. Even if you aren't, you're a guest of the tenant who hasn't vacated and he needs to serve you with formal notice, pursuant to § 55-248.31:01. Tell him that he can either work with you or have you living rent-free for as long as this crisis takes. If he changes the locks, call the police. END"}

I don't know if that's still the case (original order only suspended them until April 6,) I haven't looked for a new order yet. \n\nBut either way, don't leave, don't give up the tenancy and if locks get changed call the cops and get an attorney.  \n\nOtherwise, I wouldn't get too comfortable as the landlord can and will likely move for eviction quickly when the courts come back in session.

I signed papers and was told I had custody of my son.

I thought the same with his SSI checks when the ACS worker told me she told his mother that she had to go report that she was no longer the payer for my child. (No ssi checks for 3 months until I personally went over to see what was going on and found out she was still receiving the checks for him and still cashing them).\n His mother disappears off the face of the earth for literally 2 years. When she does pop back up she says she wants visitations. We go to court and that’s when I find out I didn’t really have “full custody” in their eyes because the paper work was from an ACS worker. But His mother didn’t dispute it. She said I could have full custody, she just as wants to see him once in awhile. We get through that, I’m told nothing about the ssi money she practically stole and gave him none of although I asked about it and even said it in court. I also told my lawyer(public defendant)about the child support issue.I’m being charged arrears and monthly fees for two years now. He said it would be in the final judgement yet the court papers I received do not state this and the public defendant no longer answers my calls.(side note: I lost my job and a lot of other things once I became a full time father. Autism isn’t easy, my son had a difficult time living with his mother his first 8 years. He wasn’t provided any help from city services or even special education because his mother didn’t find the time to get him the help he needed. No therapy, no nothing.

I have a letter from the IRS stating that she was the one who received the payments but was given no direction in what to do with it? Is this a criminal court matter? What can I do about this? \n\nI feel like she practically bailed on my son and got to steal from him with no type punishment whatsoever. Financially I’ve been put in a whole due to me taking a loan from a family member(written loan agreement) so that I could provide my son with the things he needed while I waited for the ssi checks to arrive that never did because she was stealing them. Needless to say I still owe this person money and I’ve tried to work to pay it off but my son doesn’t do to well in school so I’m constantly being called to pick him up.

This has been very frustrating and depressing….\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I AM NOT A LAWYER;\n\nYou need to apply for a modification of child support through the court. There is a form and a fee. When you get your court date, bring all your paperwork you have regarding custody, ACS paperwork included. If you lost the ACS paperwork, call the case worker or at least the office they used to work at and get someone to get you a copy of the forms. These will give you an established timeline for when you started having custody. then the Child support Should be modified to show that you started with custody on \"x\" date and they will calculate from there. Someone has to pay support, so more than likely they will order her to pay something. That amount will be back dated to the day (or should be) that you took custody from ACS. Make sure to have all your paystubs, bank records, tax forms and anything else financial with you when you go.  If this is overwhelming, look at legal aid in your area and see if they can get you a lawyer to help.\n\nif you do nothing they will make you pay her  and even take you to JAIL for not paying. \n\ngood luck END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Someone Shot Our Dog (Ohio)\nT: GOOD\nB: Yesterday, someone shot our dog.  we live in a suburban neighborhood, houses on lots of around .5 acres in Ohio.  Lots of cul-de-sacs and single family homes, very little access to major roads.  We had two dogs, both black with white and brown coloring on their chest and faces.  One long hair and one short.  My wife was heading outside to do check the weather to prep for some gardening around 11AM on Saturday 4\/11, and neglected to fully latch the door.  The dogs pushed the door open and bolted.  Both are very fast, she ran inside to get her coat and shouted for me.  The dogs ran about a block and turned left, where we couldn't see.  When she got back outside, maybe a minute later, she found one dog coming home, more slowly, when he froze and collapsed about one house away.  I managed to catch the other one with the help of a neighbor about a block further away.\n\nWe got the dog home, and he was immobile, and struggling to breathe.  He's an older dog, around 11, and the other is around 3.  We thought at first that he was struggling to keep up with the younger dog or he was hit by a car, and the adrenaline got him halfway home, until we noticed a little bit of blood on his paw.  We took him to an emergency vet, they treated him for shock and x-rayed him, and found what appeared to be a pellet lodged in his abdomen, they also found the entrance wound.  He expired about two hours later.\n\nWe called the county dog warden, and posted to NextDoor (a local social networking app) asking for information.  The Deputy took our statement and the veterinarian information, and began  questioning witnesses.  Someone reached out on NextDoor the next day to report seeing it happen.  They saw two dogs in a neighbors front yard, heard a loud noise, one of the dogs yelped, and saw two men walk out of the garage facing that front yard a few moments later.  We gave their information to the Deputy, and he took a statement.  The Deputy tells us that because nobody saw a weapon or the specific act, and the folks who \"were implicated would not come forward\" he can't move ahead with charges.  The location that the witness claims to have seen the dogs matches the timeline, and location of the dog when he collapsed.\n\nMy Questions:  \n1) Given the existing evidence, is it even worth pursuing a civil case in small claims for veterinary bills and replacement costs for the dog? (Roughly 1100 in medical bills plus some nominal amount for replacement)  \n2) If yes, what are the steps involved in collecting the statement from the neighbor?\n\nFor Example:  \n a) Should we get a signed statement?    \n b) Would it be admissible in small claims court without the witness being present?  \n c) Should we have it notarized?  \n3) Should we hold off on a civil case, and continue to escalate the criminal case with the proper authorities?  \n\n\nThank you for your advice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Guy shot his neighbors dog.

The roommate concludes the text argument declaring that the dog unfortunately needs to be out down.\n\nThis screams ridiculous to me but my friend Sarah is terrified that her dog is going to be put down. Animal control is called and upon conversation animal control doesn't even take the dog and admit it would be unethical to put the dog down. They also go to the vet and after hearing the situation the vet advises training and says it would be ridiculous to put the dog down.\n\n\nSarah comes home from work a few days later and the dog is gone. She panics and asks Kate where the dog is and Kate explains that she rehomed the dog with a family that owns land. While distraught at the loss of her animal Sarah eventually accepts that it's much better than being put down. \n\nNow we find ourselves a few weeks later and another argument flares up about something fairly stupid. Kate takes it upon herself to reveal that she actually DID take the dog and have it put down while Sarah was at work as some kind of weird hate filled spear she was saving for whenever they got into a fight.\n\n\nSarah is currently at a loss of what to do. \n\n\nMy questions are: \n\ncan Kate legally put down someone else's animal?\n\n\nCan someone euthanize an animal without the owners will?\n\n\nIt seems so odd to me that Kate could walk into a place and have an animal she has no legal ownership of put down.\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated thank you!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Anything is possible.

It's your child's money and she can't use it for personal gain.\n\nBiological paternity is irrelevant. I don't want to pry into the particulars of your situation past where you're comfortable, but if you were married to the other biological parent at the time of\/immediately prior to birth, signed a birth certificate, or signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, you're the legal father. \n\nUTMAs aren't conditional. Once money is transferred, it's transferred. Attorneys are free to send demand letters for any reason (I wouldn't send one in this circumstance, since I find it to be morally repugnant, but that's on the lawyer). They can't compel a paternity test without a court order. \n\nKeep in mind that Idaho does recognize grandparent rights for visitation. That said, your child's old enough that a court is unlikely to force him to visit the grandparents. If you need to go no contact or give them a time out, that'd be a reasonable thing to do. I would keep copies of any correspondence concerning paternity, the attorney's letter, etc. I'd also assume all future discussions concerning this were recorded and would just flat out refuse to discuss the matter until served with legal paper.\n\nRegarding the UTMA - if they try to loot the funds it would make sense to speak to a lawyer and file a police report.

{"prompt":" Q: Mentally ill man invaded our home, caretaker just watched\nT: GOOD\nB: So this happened yesterday. My brother and his girlfriend came to visit us and our kids for the first time since quarantine began (they've been isolating entirely and so have we, we decided to take the slight risk to finally see family for a day). Normally, we keep our doors locked, but this time we left the front door unlocked for a bit after they arrived. My brother and I are both big dudes, so I feel pretty comfortable having the door unlocked for an hour or so. After a bit, we were all hanging out in the rear of the house (the front door opens to a short hallway next to the stairs) talking, and nothing is amiss. At one point, my wife noticed the front door was cracked open. We assumed my brother hadn't quite closed it all the way. She poked her head out to make sure our cat hadn't run out, and noticed a man we've never seen in our neighborhood before, just sitting in his car right across the street from our house, looking at her. She gave him a weird look and closed and locked the door. \n\nA HALF HOUR LATER, it's time for our youngest to take a nap (he's 2). She gets him up for a piggy-back ride upstairs, and as soon as she gets upstairs she starts absolutely screaming \"There's someone in our house!\" Apparently some guy was in our nursery, just sitting in my wife's rocking chair. So while my brother ran upstairs, I grabbed a weapon. My brother physically forced the man downstairs and out of the house, and when we tried to get him to stop and sit down, he just wanders off. Didn't run, didn't speak, just slowly walked off in a daze. The man across the street starts yelling \"It's okay, he's with me,\" etc. and between the confusion of that, and the fact that we don't want to be grappling with strangers during a pandemic, we didn't restrain the man. Probably should have, but we were all just shocked. \n\nAs the intruder wanders down the street, the other man starts telling us that they're from a group home in the area, and he's the guy's 'caretaker' or something. He said he was with him, WATCHING HIM TRY OTHER HOUSES in the neighborhood. He won't give us a reason why he didn't stop the guy, or call the police. Something about \"I thought he knew someone around here\" was the best we could do, but his accent made it difficult to understand everything. He just didn't seem concerned at all about the fact that a man, who was apparently in his care, had just let himself into a stranger's home during a pandemic, and hung out inside for a half hour.\n\nUltimately, the police came and got all our information, and after a bit of a search, they did find the man and take him into custody, thankfully. The guy seemed to be pretty out of it, we couldn't tell if he was extremely drugged up or just really mentally incompetent, but the caretaker told us he was 'psychotic' so that makes me feel even worse. I suppose, as home invasions go, we're thankful that this was an ultimately benign incident, but we sure won't feel right for a while.

{"prompt":" Q: Dental surgeon didn't know what teeth to pull...asked my boyfriend.\nT: GOOD\nB: Hi, this is a throwaway for various reasons. I'll keep this as short as possible and will answer questions if necessary. I also don't post to reddit normally, so I'm sorry if this isn't right or is formatted weirdly.\n\nI was referred to a dental surgeon by my dentist who I very recently began going to. The referral was originally for one tooth that needed to be removed and would eventually become an implant. X-rays were taken and sent to the surgeon. I called both offices to confirm. I went to a consultation, during which I explained to the surgeon that I woke up during other oral surgeries and that I do not react well to anesthesia. More X-rays were taken by the implant surgeon. While waiting for the removal appointment, I had a filling come out on the other side of my mouth and it ended up needing to also be an implant. Again, X-rays and updates were sent to the surgeon on March 1.\n\nThe day before my procedure, I was given a prescription for something to \"relax\" me. I was sent a consent form with teeth #30 and #19 to be removed in order to take this prescription. I signed the consent and scanned it back to the office. I took the pill as prescribed and it did not have any effect on me that I could tell. I let them know I felt nothing when I arrived for the procedure. I felt rushed through the paperwork when I went inside and was told \"we need to hurry we are behind\" (it was 7:45 AM). I paid what I owed in cash, for both teeth. I was given nitrous through a mask and felt nothing. I began to cry (because I wasn't feeling safe) and try to speak to the nurse, but she continued to hook me up to monitors and talk to people outside of the room.  I told them they would not be able to find a vein in my right arm, but they attempted anyway. The dental surgeon came in and found a vein in my left arm and started the anesthesia. Before I fell asleep, I heard the surgeon ask which two teeth to pull.\n\nWhen I woke up, they had pulled one tooth. I immediately asked what happened and they responded that they could not keep me asleep long enough to pull the second. I refused to leave without seeing the surgeon, but they called in my boyfriend (he had driven me) and I was walked to the car. When I was at home with my prescriptions, my boyfriend informed me that they had walked out to his truck and said: \"she is finally asleep, do you know what teeth we are supposed to pull\"? I was livid. I slept through the weekend and called them on Monday. At no point in the conversation did they tell me they had to ask him what teeth. They DID tell me that I TOLD THEM the wrong teeth numbers so they didn't know which ones. I asked if they had my records and my X-rays and they confirmed. I asked why they didn't consult the records and they said \"you signed the consent for the wrong tooth\". I hung up and contacted my dentist. She confirmed that my records were sent on March 1 again and seemed upset.

I'll try to be helpful but there are some gaps here in your provided information.   I know this isn't legal advice but it doesn't sound like there's a legal remedy to this.\n\nFirst, you don't say what the actual problem with Expedia is?  Or what you believe it may be?  Is it that their customer service unhelpful and slow?  Yes, it's awful and I saw that as someone who used to work there.  I never bothered with customer service and went directly to the airline carrier when there was a problem because ultimately they own the inventory they sold through Expedia.  Expedia just provides the platform to access the inventory.   So, it would be helpful to understand where you believe the problem may be with Expedia's service?\n\nSecond, have your daughter double-check that the confirmation she received from the carrier is actual.   Confirmations come directly from the airline and they issue the serial code for the confirmation, Expedia only sends this information along to the person who bought the ticket.   The first thing to determine is that there wasn't a breakdown in confirmation from the airline itself and that the confirmation number she was issued by the airline is valid.   It's rare but the airline can sometimes issue an invalid confirmation serial, which is an error on the airline's part and not Expedia.\n\nThird, you are much better off attempting to fix this through the carrier directly.  It's their seat in their plane and their issued ticket.  Expedia customer service will be an intermediary in trying to make a change to a ticket or correct a problem but if the problem didn't result from Expedia's handling, they're also relying on the carrier to agree to a fix.  This is usually successful, but sometimes it's not.  \n\nIt's much better to work through the carrier 99% of the time.  If the customer service agent for the carrier tries to send your daughter back to Expedia, have her insist on speaking to a supervisor with the carrier. END"}

When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.\n\nAt the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son \"tested positive for cocaine\" \\[not presumptive\\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said \"I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained.

{"prompt":" Q: [CA] CPS took my newborn son over a presumptive positive cocaine test\nT: BAD\nB: \\[TL;DR: My son was taken away by CPS over a presumptive positive while still at hospital. The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\\]\n\nMy son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.\n\nIn this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to \"neonatal abstinence syndrome\" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.\n\nAt the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son \"tested positive for cocaine\" \\[not presumptive\\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said \"I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.\"\n\nBy the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.\n\nI find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to \"this is routine, we always change the case worker\".\n\nDesperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.\n\nMar 4th \"Jurisdictional\" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.\n\nI start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.\n\nFinally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says \"I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted\". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!\n\n2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says \"based on the \\[egregiously err'd\\] report I still find your son should be withheld\". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says \"mom is denying the allegations\". He says \"Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th\". My lawyer tells me I've made things complicated.\n\nI thought this nightmare would end on Friday &amp; I'm still in utter shock it didn't. I live in SoCal where there aren't many attorney options I can find, or resources to help me. I'm a DACA \"dreamer\", all my family is in the UK. I'm stuck in a nightmare situation.\n\nI haven't had more than 15 minute video chats with my son since they took him. I have a good home, full of baby supplies, gifts, and cute clothes he's already grown out of. I took his crib out of my room because I cried every night looking at it. I've never even had a speeding ticket, never touched cigarettes or alcohol while pregnant, and have never done drugs, yet my lawyer keeps telling me the \"bar is very low\" under dependency law - I just don't understand how I am still here.\n\nI wish I had good questions. I guess they are:\n\n* Is there anything I should be doing differently? I am told appeals court rarely goes against the lower courts.\n* Is there grounds for a civil case that would maybe help motivate someone to help me on contingency?

She also may not back charge you for water use, even after installing individual meters.\n\nShe needs to deal with this like a professional and look for leaks.

{"prompt":" Q: What can you do if you were forced into a marriage overseas but live in the USA?\nT: GOOD\nB: So this was actually 5 years ago. My family was in Macedonia(my parents are from there) and then a week before we were going to come back my parents forced me to get married to a guy. \n\nWe fought about this before but they were threatening to abandon me there and wouldn’t give me my wallet, phone or passport.\nSo on paper I’m married to some guy there. My parents did this for a number of reasons. They think I’m ugly, stupid, disabled(because I need glasses) and because I have a brother with adhd, no man would want me to have their babies because they could have adhd too.\nI didn’t even kiss the guy. Which pissed him off because he kept wanting me to have sex with him cause he wanted to get me pregnant so I’ll be anchored to him.\nThe marriage was just signing paper a paper, but the guy literally asked “you want to get married and no one is forcing you to do this?” I said nothing. He said were married now. Everyone was pissed at how unhappy I looked.\n\nThen after we came back to the us I filled an immigration spouse  application and paid around $500-600.\nThe next few months I was freaking out and was told “well, you were 18! You should have just said no! Just look on the bright side of being married!”\nI was suppose to send in tax returns but instead I threw them into a McDonald’s drive thru garbage can. So, after that I ran away from home and spent a year being homeless and living in a women’s shelter. \nThe people there were unhelpful, which is putting it nicely. But I keep thinking about how they kept telling me that my “husband” could come to the USA and take all my money!”\nI was homeless. I had no money.

Now I feel like I should look into getting tested. I'm beyond angry. \n\nI have two questions...\n\n1) I am on the borderline of pressing charges. That, in my mind, was assault. Was it? How much of a hassle am I going to get into if I go down this road? I'm sure Target has it all on camera. As angry as I am, I really don't know if I want to go down a path where I have to get a lawyer, go to court... ugh.\n\n2) This is a moot point now, but I find myself wondering... What would have happened if I did slug her? Is that self-defense? On one hand I wish I had, and on the other I'm glad I didn't.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" &gt; She committed assault.\n\nUh, what?!?!

{"prompt":" Q: Mail is being withheld from us for a “dangerous dog hold” on a dog that is no longer living.\nT: GOOD\nB: This may be long winded so I’ll add a TLDR at the end. This has been an ongoing matter for about a year now. Initially, we got a red card in the mail saying “dangerous dog, mail withheld” on a dog that had been at our residence for 10+ years. For whatever reason, the carriers decided the dog was too vicious and asked us to move our mail box away from the door (2 inch thick wooden door WITH a security screen, just as the postal service mandates) even though there was no way of him getting out. So, we complied and moved it to the fence along side our driveway, about 5 feet from the public sidewalk. All is well and we continue to get mail. Then, about 4-5 months later, our dog dies (old age, RIP). We kept our mailbox in the same spot UNTIL we noticed mail and packages going missing. Presumably they were stolen because of how easily accessible the mailbox was at this location. So we moved the mail box back to its original spot that it had been in since this house was built in like the 1940s. Again, all is well until about a month later, we receive ANOTHER “dangerous dog” notice in our mail box with no mail. We go to the post office to speak to the post master and ask “what dog are you referring to?” and we couldn’t get an answer. They just keep saying “move your mailbox”. We tell them ma is being stolen but they don’t care. Now the post master is being deliberately rude. We’ve spoken to multiple people including the post master and consumer affairs and they keep saying “we’ll have to come to a decision”. The dog is literally in ashes. There is no viable reason to withhold mail on a dog hold for a dog that doesn’t exist. So now, we have to go to the post office multiple times a week to pick up our mail, during a pandemic I might add. Sometimes they can’t even find it and we have to come back another day. But here’s the part that really set me off. This morning I go in and pick up a weeks worth of mail and I’m going through the stack and I find a bright yellow card that has our address on it, in bold letters on the bottom it says “do not deliver this card” so it’s obvious this is for the use of the post office only. On the back of the card, written in marker in all caps its says, “DOG HOLD FOREVER LOL”. It actually says “lol” at the bottom. Someone very obviously made a mistake by letting this get lost in my stack of mail. This proves to me that this isn’t a legitimate issue and they are just being petty for the hell of it. What can I do here? I refuse to move my mail box and let my mail continue to be stolen. What is my next step to get this resolved?\n\nTLDR: Mail withheld for dangerous dog.

{"prompt":" Q: Am I Responsible For a Single Bed Bug Found In My Apartment? (Michigan if that's important)\nT: GOOD\nB: A few months ago I found a single bed bug in my laundry basket it was un-fed and could barely move, this made it easy to capture. I took a picture and sent it to our land-lord, he came by to verify and had an exterminator come by two days later. When the exterminator he asked us if any furniture was new, we told him our couch was new, and he proceeded to check it along with the rest of the furniture and their crevices. He found absolutely nothing; he wanted to spray so we complied. Before we left the apartment for three hours, I asked the exterminator where he thinks the bed bug came from and he said \"It probably hitched a ride on someone outside and ended up in the laundry room, where it then found it's way into your clothes\".\n\nA few weeks later the building manager sent me a text saying that the exterminator would be coming back in a couple of days for a second inspection. When he arrived he was not alone, he was with our land lord. After the exterminator re-checked our furniture and found nothing, the exterminator said he wanted to spray again and the land-lord not the tenant gave him the go ahead to spray again.\n\nFast Forwarding to the beginning of June, I get a bill for seven-hundred and five dollars.

{"prompt":" Q: Coworker physically assaulted me at work and HR has done nothing about for a month. [MA]\nT: GOOD\nB: I’m not sure what I should do about the situation, or if this sub is the right one to post on, but let’s see. I could use some direction. I’ve revised the story a bit and withheld names and other identifying info. \n\nThe incident occurred at the beginning of June. After having a conversation with my boss in the late afternoon after the incident, we both decided that the assault should be reported to HR, and so I filed the complaint the next morning. \n\nThe assault took place in an office shared by 8 employees. Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don’t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated. So imagine my shock when this employee sicks a blow to the back of my head. \n\nThe employee is “untouchable”, as in, he’s the best man we have on the floor (almost a supervisor) and he’s gotten away with many things in the past. He looks down upon others but will chat you up like you’re important to him. He likes to sound smarter than he really is. He mingles with upper management so he is well liked and well-received by them. He is my superior. This is important to note. \n\nUnprovoked and out of the blue, he comes into the office and, seeing that I was reading a book on my lunch break, smacks me in the back of the head, causing my glasses to fall from my face and onto my desk. It was a hard blow to the head, and throbbed some time later. Absolutely irate, I turned to face the offending employee with tears in my eyes as four of my office coworkers erupted in laughter at my expense. I didn’t think what the employee had done was funny in the slightest. I couldn’t believe he had done such a stupid thing, someone with his level of seniority and intelligence. \n\nI was shocked and angry. Through tears, I made it clear that I didn’t find the situation funny. The employee that hit me laughed at my response, as if the ordeal had been in good fun, and said “it was just a joke”. Keep in mind, we are all approaching our thirties and he is in his forties... really? He offered a pitiful apology and left the office while I sat there, astonished. I faced the laughing coworkers and said, \"I am glad that you all found that funny,\" to which they ignored me and went right back to working. \n\nAfter the incident, I was very visibly troubled and upset. I feel completely disrespected and unhappy, so much so that I was unable to sleep at night and have cried in the arms of my significant other. I have had to visit a therapist to process what has happened as I have an anxiety disorder and this has thrown me into a state of perpetual panic. I think, above all else, I’m taken aback by the lack of sympathy - upon seeing how upset I was, the employee did not take my concern seriously. I was hit, and hard - with enough force to smack the glasses off of my face. \n\nPlease bear in mind that this is not the first time this employee has hurt me “in good fun”.  We’ve had issues in the past with him flicking the back of my head as I’m working at my desk or clapping extremely loud near my ears to startle me, as a joke I presume. These “jokes” eventually stopped when I asked him to back off. Because he stopped, I didn’t report the incidents to HR and figured we could just move past them like adults. He’s also, as I’ve mentioned, really well liked by the managers, so I didn’t want to be “that employee” that makes HR complaints. \n\nAfter an initial call with an HR rep from corporate, I haven’t heard a word in many weeks. Nothing. They said they were going to investigate and asked me what the outcome should be, and I said I wanted the employee terminated. Each meeting the HR rep schedules with me, she cancels and plans again for a later date. She’s done this 5 times now... citing that she is busy and can’t speak to me sooner. \n\nI sent an email to the HR manager saying that I wanted to reach out and discuss my concerns involving the incident and that I am concerned about HR’s lack of communication with me regarding such a sensitive matter. I said that I have messages that haven’t been responded to and I am deeply unsatisfied. I mentioned that I had to leave the workplace due to a panic attack on (date) and spent the remaining day in a state of paralyzing anxiety. As politely as I could, I explained that employees of the past have been terminated over lesser infractions, so I do not think it’s wrong that I feel unhappy about my company’s inaction. Towards the end of the email, I said that I only want to feel safe at work, and I believe - given the severity of the situation - that the employee should be terminated for violating workplace policies and harming me. Of course, I said everything as professionally as I could whilst holding back emotion. \n\nBut alas, I’ve heard nothing back in days now. \n\nWhat can I do to close this situation, if anything? I’d like to speed up the process but at this point, I wish I had filed a police report. Maybe then they would take this seriously. I worry they will find a reason to release me from employment because I filed a report against the company’s “Golden boy”, and I’m feeling a bit defeated. They may fire me “for performance” or something of the sort... a gut feeling. \n\nThank you guys.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" NAL. The statute of limitations on assault in Florida is 4 year.

Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don’t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated. So imagine my shock when this employee sicks a blow to the back of my head. \n\nThe employee is “untouchable”, as in, he’s the best man we have on the floor (almost a supervisor) and he’s gotten away with many things in the past. He looks down upon others but will chat you up like you’re important to him. He likes to sound smarter than he really is. He mingles with upper management so he is well liked and well-received by them. He is my superior. This is important to note. \n\nUnprovoked and out of the blue, he comes into the office and, seeing that I was reading a book on my lunch break, smacks me in the back of the head, causing my glasses to fall from my face and onto my desk. It was a hard blow to the head, and throbbed some time later. Absolutely irate, I turned to face the offending employee with tears in my eyes as four of my office coworkers erupted in laughter at my expense. I didn’t think what the employee had done was funny in the slightest. I couldn’t believe he had done such a stupid thing, someone with his level of seniority and intelligence. \n\nI was shocked and angry. Through tears, I made it clear that I didn’t find the situation funny. The employee that hit me laughed at my response, as if the ordeal had been in good fun, and said “it was just a joke”. Keep in mind, we are all approaching our thirties and he is in his forties... really? He offered a pitiful apology and left the office while I sat there, astonished. I faced the laughing coworkers and said, \"I am glad that you all found that funny,\" to which they ignored me and went right back to working. \n\nAfter the incident, I was very visibly troubled and upset. I feel completely disrespected and unhappy, so much so that I was unable to sleep at night and have cried in the arms of my significant other. I have had to visit a therapist to process what has happened as I have an anxiety disorder and this has thrown me into a state of perpetual panic. I think, above all else, I’m taken aback by the lack of sympathy - upon seeing how upset I was, the employee did not take my concern seriously. I was hit, and hard - with enough force to smack the glasses off of my face. \n\nPlease bear in mind that this is not the first time this employee has hurt me “in good fun”.  We’ve had issues in the past with him flicking the back of my head as I’m working at my desk or clapping extremely loud near my ears to startle me, as a joke I presume. These “jokes” eventually stopped when I asked him to back off. Because he stopped, I didn’t report the incidents to HR and figured we could just move past them like adults. He’s also, as I’ve mentioned, really well liked by the managers, so I didn’t want to be “that employee” that makes HR complaints. \n\nAfter an initial call with an HR rep from corporate, I haven’t heard a word in many weeks. Nothing. They said they were going to investigate and asked me what the outcome should be, and I said I wanted the employee terminated. Each meeting the HR rep schedules with me, she cancels and plans again for a later date. She’s done this 5 times now... citing that she is busy and can’t speak to me sooner. \n\nI sent an email to the HR manager saying that I wanted to reach out and discuss my concerns involving the incident and that I am concerned about HR’s lack of communication with me regarding such a sensitive matter. I said that I have messages that haven’t been responded to and I am deeply unsatisfied. I mentioned that I had to leave the workplace due to a panic attack on (date) and spent the remaining day in a state of paralyzing anxiety. As politely as I could, I explained that employees of the past have been terminated over lesser infractions, so I do not think it’s wrong that I feel unhappy about my company’s inaction. Towards the end of the email, I said that I only want to feel safe at work, and I believe - given the severity of the situation - that the employee should be terminated for violating workplace policies and harming me. Of course, I said everything as professionally as I could whilst holding back emotion. \n\nBut alas, I’ve heard nothing back in days now. \n\nWhat can I do to close this situation, if anything? I’d like to speed up the process but at this point, I wish I had filed a police report. Maybe then they would take this seriously. I worry they will find a reason to release me from employment because I filed a report against the company’s “Golden boy”, and I’m feeling a bit defeated. They may fire me “for performance” or something of the sort... a gut feeling. \n\nThank you guys.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Next time someone hits you, call the police to report the assault. END"}

Determined who drafted the will, and contacted them to give them some information related to the situation. The lawyer I spoke with was very helpful in calming me down, and explained that the portion of the will acknowledging that his daughter will not be receiving anything will safeguard me should she contest his will. He also advised that should the will be formally contested he would be happy to present me with options for lawyers who can help at his firm. \n2. I have stopped communicating with my step-sister and her mother, as it ultimately seems useless to keep them in the loop. My only communication to them from here on out will be with regard to my step-fathers memorial which I have been setting up. \n\nAgain, thank you so much to everyone who commented. I lacked confidence when I made the post this morning, and I am super grateful that you guys have helped restore that confidence. I will not be gaslighted into thinking that I do not have a chance anymore - this is MY childhood home and MY father, and should it come down to it, I hope the legal system will agree. Thank you to everyone for setting me straight and showing me the several ways in which this situation can unfold. I wish all of you well, and may make an update post in the future once this all settles. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: My wife is a pregnant nurse and is being forced to work with Covid-19 patients outside of her usual job responsibilities\nT: GOOD\nB: I checked the sticky post but didn't see anything that addressed this issue. \n\nMy wife is a labor and delivery (L&amp;D) nurse in Virginia, and she is 20 weeks pregnant. Her department tests all incoming L&amp;D patients for Covid-19. After we found out that she is pregnant, her doctor provided a note advising that she no longer work with Covid-positive patients, as pregnant women are at higher risk for severe Covid illness. The hospital provided this accommodation for her. The doctor also advised against getting the vaccine while pregnant, since it is not approved for pregnant women and there is no data regarding the vaccine and pregnancy. \n\nWith the current Covid spike, her hospital's Covid-19 floor is losing nurses - some are quitting and many are getting sick. My wife is now being told that she needs to work shifts on the Covid floor despite the following factors:\n\n- She is NOT a med-surg nurse and has no expertise in caring for Covid patients\n- According to the CDC, pregnant women are immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19\n- Her doctor (who works at this hospital) strongly advises her against any exposure to Covid patients; the doctor has also directly communicated this to my wife's supervisor\n- She is one of the very few pregnant nurses, and one of the only nurses that will not receive the vaccine within the next month; this means that almost all other nurses will have essentially no risk of illness while working with Covid-19 patients \n\nI'm aware that being pregnant is not considered a disability under ADA.

She has spoken to several OBGYNs on her unit, and they have given her different advice. Some say not to get the vaccine because there is no data, while others recommend getting it even though possible consequences to the fetus are unknown.\n\nEdit: I just read the SMFM statement, and it recommends that the vaccine be made available to pregnant healthcare workers, and that the decision to be vaccinated be made in consultation with a healthcare provider. It doesn't specifically recommend that pregnant healthcare workers be vaccinated. \n\nThis is very a very irritating situation because she is not needed on this assignment - there are plenty of low-risk nurses available at the hospital. Her management is putting us in a position to decide wether to risk Covid infection or risk unknown fetal consequences from the vaccine, for something that is not even part of her job. END"}

And the college of all the obgyns have said it’s okay and that’s what we base our actions on.  As a nurse I don’t care who’s pregnant or not, we have a duty to fulfill.  Plus there’s going to be Covid positive pregnant people to care for regardless.  So maybe just do your job and use the proper precautions because your wife is no more important than any other nurse pregnant or not...we all have families and loved ones we want to keep safe but we have no choice but to do our job.  There’s plenty of pregnant nurses already caring for Covid patients.  The best thing for you guys to do is to realize that no one wants to care for Covid patients but you aren’t more special than anyone else so do your job.  Here we have educators manning the swabbing stations.  They have no requirement for patient care but they still do it. END"}

Throughout those four years it became apparent that the dad is an extremely toxic human. \n\nWe wanted to move out on year 3 as well as year 4 but he convinced my gf that he would sell us the house as it was hers. She bought the house in Feb. before the pandemic really took off. Living in lockdown with him became even more mentally taxing. Which led to an argument that lasted two days where the situation escalated and I was assaulted by the dad. All this occurred first week in June. \n\nDid not press charges or retain an PPO as it didn’t seem necessary. \n\nSept 12th we had arranged for him to come to the house and retrieve the rest of his belongings. He was assisted by movers and several family members ( one of whom has stage four cancer and fosters 2 young girls), to take his things out of the house. At the time I was advised I shouldn’t be at the house to avoid any heated arguments. \n\nHe proceeded to take the washer, dryer, couch, chair, which were items he had purchased but several of my belongings he took as well thinking they were his or out of spite.

{"prompt":" Q: I got bit badly by a rescue dog\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Chesapeake, Va. I was badly bitten on my neck by a dog we adopted and required about 30 stitches. For the back story, a couple posted the dog on a rehoming page because they said they couldn’t care for him any more. They said he was a good, well behaved dog that was great with older kids and cats. They disclosed that they adopted the dog from an animal rescue, and were under a contract with them, where if they couldn’t care for the dog, they would surrender him back to the rescue. The rescue told them that they did not have room for the dog, and told them to try to rehome him. We responded to the post about the dog and talked to the owner. We also talked to the animal rescue person about him, who said he was a really good dog and they never had any problems with him. The rescue person said we could sign a new adoption contract and adopt him if we wanted. We met the owners, the dog seemed really good, so we signed and brought him home. We had him for a week or so and everything was good. Thursday, my son was sitting on the couch with the dog. I kneeled down to pet the dog when he growled and lunged at my neck and tore it open. My 12 year old son witnessed the whole thing. My wife took me to the ER where they cleaned the bite and stitched it up. We contacted the rescue and told them what happened, and told them we have to surrender the dog. They told us they didn’t have room, and it would be up to us to rehome him again. They then went on to say that he must have done it because he was being protective of my son or because I was provoking him. We called city animal control and surrendered the dog to them. Because of the severity of the bite, they said he would be quarantined for 2 weeks. My wife did some poking around on the rescue’s website and found more information. About this dog. He bit a previous owner’s daughter in the face where she required stitches, which was not disclosed to us by the rescue. I apologize for the lengthy backstory, but wanted to try to get the facts in there. My questions are: What will happen if the rescue tries to sue us for breach of contract for not rehoming the dog?

{"prompt":" Q: I got bit badly by a rescue dog\nT: GOOD\nB: I live in Chesapeake, Va. I was badly bitten on my neck by a dog we adopted and required about 30 stitches. For the back story, a couple posted the dog on a rehoming page because they said they couldn’t care for him any more. They said he was a good, well behaved dog that was great with older kids and cats. They disclosed that they adopted the dog from an animal rescue, and were under a contract with them, where if they couldn’t care for the dog, they would surrender him back to the rescue. The rescue told them that they did not have room for the dog, and told them to try to rehome him. We responded to the post about the dog and talked to the owner. We also talked to the animal rescue person about him, who said he was a really good dog and they never had any problems with him. The rescue person said we could sign a new adoption contract and adopt him if we wanted. We met the owners, the dog seemed really good, so we signed and brought him home. We had him for a week or so and everything was good. Thursday, my son was sitting on the couch with the dog. I kneeled down to pet the dog when he growled and lunged at my neck and tore it open. My 12 year old son witnessed the whole thing. My wife took me to the ER where they cleaned the bite and stitched it up. We contacted the rescue and told them what happened, and told them we have to surrender the dog. They told us they didn’t have room, and it would be up to us to rehome him again. They then went on to say that he must have done it because he was being protective of my son or because I was provoking him. We called city animal control and surrendered the dog to them. Because of the severity of the bite, they said he would be quarantined for 2 weeks. My wife did some poking around on the rescue’s website and found more information. About this dog. He bit a previous owner’s daughter in the face where she required stitches, which was not disclosed to us by the rescue. I apologize for the lengthy backstory, but wanted to try to get the facts in there. My questions are: What will happen if the rescue tries to sue us for breach of contract for not rehoming the dog? We did not feel safe with the dog in the house and immediately had animal control take him. My other question: Is the animal rescue negligent in not disclosing to us that this dog attacked someone before? He bit a teenaged girl and knew that we have a preteen son in the house.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You didn't break any contract, you called the rescue shelter and were told by them they could not honor that portion of the contract. If they are not happy with your choice of rehoming options then they could have been proactive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would try and touch base with a lawyer, if there was history of aggression that was not disclosed you may be able to get back your medical bills related to the bite.

In your hypo, saying “actionhero was investigated by the police for the mysterious death of his wife”, if you had in fact been investigated, wouldn’t be untruthful. Saying “actionhero killed his wife” or even “in my opinion, actionhero killed his wife” would open them to liability if the statement was unfounded or untrue. Another issue is whether the person believed the statement, or if they had serious doubts about the truth of the matter and said it anyway. Yet another component is whether the person saying that to your employer was negligent in the sense that they didn’t try to find out if the statement was true before saying it... as in “I heard that actionhero killed his wife”. It sounds like the OP’s girlfriend believes what she is saying to be true. If I were her, I’d stick to stating the facts (he was investigated for XYZ”) instead of the more risky “he did XYZ”, because then she’ll need to demonstrate why she believes that to be true and what she’s basin that belief on.

But either way I know the chance of reopening the case and winning against him is zero to none, but...\n\nWhat are our options here? I hate to see this type of injustice but I know the reality that many court cases ultimately boil down to who can afford a better lawyer. Does  she have no choice but to retract her statements and just pray she doesn’t get sued? And what are the potential outcomes in case she does get sued, would she lose a ton of money or potentially face charges on her record? \n\nNeither of us have any experience with these sorts of things so we seriously appreciate it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What state are you in?\n\nGenerally, truth is an absolute defense against claims of defamation (libel or slander). From what you said, your girlfriend contacted the coaches and told them **about the charges** that ended up getting dismissed. Simply notifying a person and telling them that someone else has had criminal charges brought against them doesn’t rise to the level of defamation, because it’s both factual and a part of the public record. This is no different than an employer doing a background check to determine an applicant’s arrest history. However, she may be open to liability if she contacted the coaches to say that he actually did sell kiddy porn, since the matter has already been adjudicated.\n\nYou can see some of the elements necessary for proving defamation [here](https:\/\/injury.findlaw.com\/torts-and-personal-injuries\/elements-of-libel-and-slander.html).

I painted, purchased light fixtures and assisted in every step of the process when fixing up the house. Bought the house at $140,000. When the house sold, we owed $122,000 and they sold the house for $160,000. \n\nI got an email from the ex’s mom prior to sale price going public saying they took a loss and NO ONE was getting anything back. They claimed they had put in $12,000 (which is false) and they were losing all of their money, the ex was losing all his money and so was I. Made me giggle, at the end of that email, she forgot to delete a sentence from her draft saying “you will get a $1,000 and nothing more”. I got zero as they clearly changed their minds. Turns out, I was the only one who lost all my money because they took all profits from the sale of our home and used it as a down payment for a new house for him.

She made up “charges” that I owe them like disposal of a piano I left at the house - the ex just admitted to keeping it as a “project”. I have receipts and cancelled checks, the mortgage company understood the arrangement as did the initial realtor. Taking into account there was no contract between us, do I have any legal recourse? In addition to the email where she (generally) admits the arrangement, I believe there is a good chance I could get the real estate agent to attest to my version of the events. \n\nSide notes - not sure any of this matters but, some additional detail... my new job had paid a total of $50,000 for me to move and that included paying the portion of my previous mortgage that was upside down. The reason I left was he was an alcoholic and the relationship got progressively abusive. he was a serial cheater and I moved out specifically when I found out he slept with his coworker while we were living together (again, this was ongoing) in the parking lot outside the building they worked in.

They sold the house because the ex could not afford the $1,100\/month mortgage. After I moved out, mommy and daddy paid the mortgage for him because he couldn’t. \n\nI think you can gather from my post - I’m bitter.

{"prompt":" Q: My roommate accuses me of stealing from her and says she will call the police if I don’t let her search my room and go through my closet, boxes, and suitcases. Location: Washington, DC.\nT: BAD\nB: So I am an international student currently living in DC. I had planned to return home right after my graduation in May but got stuck in the US due to the coronavirus lockdown, but I hope to leave as soon as possible by July or august at the latest. \n\nMy university campus shut down in March, and because I couldn’t go home, I moved into a short term sublet until I can return home. Basically, I am living out of boxes and suitcases and have no desire of unpacking or settling down at this house, I just want to go home as soon as I can. Enter my housemate. Last week, she told me that she was missing several items of clothing and some jewelry and thought that I had taken them. She asked to search my room alone, open my boxes, suitcases, etc. I refused because a) she isn’t my landlord, b) I felt that I had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and c) she couldn’t even give me an exact inventory of the things I supposedly stole. Things were fine, if awkward, until yesterday, when she entered my room without my permission while I wasn’t there and tried to search through my things. I caught her and told her in no uncertain terms to stay out. Now she says she will call the police if I don’t consent to a search of everything I have so she can ensure I haven’t stolen from her. \n\nI am totally at my wits end.

I couldn't find much online about this term, but it's possible I don't have the right legal vocabulary to search properly. When it comes to property lines, is there an easement I need to be concerned about and, if so, what?

I've heard that if a tree is on my neighbor's side but branches of it extend over to my side, I am allowed to trim those branches back. Is that true? And what about trees that sit directly on the property line? Who is allowed to do what with them?

Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" NAL, but I've worked in the field with several cases dealing with easements like this.\n\nMy two cents is this -- you're definitely going to need a lawyer (self-help is out of the question), and the costs you can expect will be $3000 at the lowest (assuming the neighbors and their lawyer are cooperative) to $5-30k if the neighbors put up a fight, or even up to hundreds of thousands if it went as far as litigation.\n\nConsidering that the neighbors may potentially have that \"easement to an existing structure\" (I have absolutely no clue on the merits of this, but let's assume it is valid) it may turn out to actually benefit you in a way -- because both of you have each something to give and something to take, it's quite likely the attorneys could agree to simply give your few feet closest to their driveway in exchange for you getting the larger area of land.\n\nBottom line, no matter who is really legally int eh right or not, both parties can sue over this if they want, and oftentimes they'll do it not just cause they think they'll win, but because it raises the ante in terms of legal fees -- it says \"I'm willing to dig my heels in and spend a ton of money on litigation -- are you?\".  And even though there's laws against frivolous lawsuits like that, you have to fight the whole case first, win, and then take up that issue -- which is such a heavy burden itself that you'd likely just want to settle fast like they wanted you to.  Considering this all, I think the lawyers would be highly inclined to both avoid litigation and each concede something, even if it's imbalanced, simply because both sides would be getting something and because litigation would be extremely expensive with very little to gain that you couldn't with simple negotiations.  Just try to find yourself a transactional real estate attorney first rather than a litigator. END"}

What can she do?\n\nShe is always welcome to stay with me. She has a couple hundred dollars. Any advice or help would be appreciated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not a lawyer, am a social worker. \n\nGenerally leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous part of the relationship. The abuse CANNOT know she is thinking about leaving. \n\nShe needs to get legal representation for the divorce. Local domestic violence groups can help her. That lawyer can help her with legal stuff like restraining orders, custody, and the divorce. DV groups may have a low cost or free lawyer program. \n\nHere’s my social work, practical advice (not strictly legal but important)\n\nCalling the DV groups on her phone could be dangerous, so she should not call on any phone to which he has access. I know you said your family doesn’t have a lot of money. If you and your family can pull together ~$50 you should be able to get her a cheap prepaid phone and a nicer phone for more money. This phone should not be anywhere he can find it. See if she can leave it at work or you can get it or something. When she leaves she should leave her current phone at their home. Have her send anything important to the cloud or you if it is safe. \n\nSomeone will need to find her a place to go. Domestic Violence Shelters will keep her safe and are fairly restrictive out of necessity. If she does not want to go to a shelter and goes to a friends or family members home that he knows about she and the people she is staying with could be in danger. The best thing is for her to go to a place that he doesn’t know about. Maybe a new apartment or a friend of the family. \n\nAny documentation of the abuse could prove helpful in getting a restraining order and to keep custody after the divorce. She can take pictures on a phone he cannot access. Have them sent to you or backed up on the cloud. Pictures of any cameras that she can safely get. Pictures on her second phone of texts and emails. \n\nShe will need her and her child’s legal documents eventually. IF she can get them out of the home and to a safe person safely she should do so. This likely means taking them with them when she leaves. If she can’t do that but has pictures of the documents that’s fine for right now. If she can’t do this her life is more important. After she leaves she will need to lock her credit there is a sticky on r\/personalfinance that talks about that more. \n\nShe likely won’t have access to their money once she leaves. If she has a personal account she can move that money when she is in a safe place. She should be able to call the institution and lock down that money when she leaves. \n\nShe and the child will need to leave when he is away. She may have no time so getting a small supply of things at your home or another trusted persons home that can be brought to her wherever will be helpful. Think shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, tampons, hair brush, clothes, and diapers. \n\nSome states and cities have domestic violence leave for someone leaving a DV situation. If she has that, great! Use it. If not going to work can be dangerous and she should arraigned for some time off, WFH, or a transfer to a different location. \n\nHe may have trackers on the car, in any case he will likely be able to recognize the car, so she should leave it or hide it away from where she is staying. \n\nHer safety is the priority here and this is fairy general advice. Someone who works for a DV group can provide more specifics. \n\nDomestic Violence hotlines are not only for the person being abused. You can call and get more loca guidance for her. They may have funds and items available since leaving is expensive. To get connected you can use google or call the United Way’s 211\n\nEdited to Add:\nPolice may help but they may put her in more danger if they don’t arrest. If they come she and the child should leave with them. \n\nIllinois does have DV leave under the Victims Economic Security and Safety Act. She can get 12 total weeks of unpaid leave every 12 months.

{"prompt":" Q: A brother coming to you for advice. My sister is in a physically abusive relationship and has asked me for help on what she should do but I am lost. He has planted secret cameras around the house, hooked up bluetooth devices to her phones so he can listen in on her, and physically abuses her.\nT: BAD\nB: She is in a relationship with someone who grabs, chokes, slaps, and slams her into walls. Growing up with her I can tell you she is the most timid and kind person in the world. She was always shy and quite. She has been enduring this for years without telling anyone but I saw bruises on her side when she reached to get something out of a cupboard and asked her what happened and she started crying and wouldn't talk to me about it. Finally she told me about all the abuse she has been getting when we were away from the house alone.\n\nShe is broke. She has no money and his family has money and connections in the town. She is afraid that even if she did try to get a divorce the she would be going up against someone who has a good lawyer and she would be left to defend herself.\n\nDetails:\n\n1. She found installed a smart camera wall outlet wifi device.\n2. He has complete control over her phone and he connects Bluetooth devices or somehow is able to listen to her calls because she said he has mentioned things that she talked about away from him on the phone and she heard herself come over a speaker in their house one time.\n3. He started asking her a year ago to get life insurance. What the fuck? She said that he has been asking her nonstop every couple of weeks saying they need to get life insurance.\n4. He has their home computer encrypted so only he can log into it.\n5. He installed something behind the drywall in their house. I know it sounds crazy but she showed me the wall outlet cameras so I know she is not exaggerating.\n6. He is openly admitting that he cheats on her.\n7. They live in Illinois where I thought it was illegal to record someone else?\n8. They have a son that is 1.\n9. The abuse really kicked up when he lost his job due to covid and he is at home all the time now.\n10. They have one vehicle.\n11. They are both signed on the vehicle and home mortgage.\n12. She pays all of the house payments.\n13. For some reason he bought smart wifi light bulbs but didn't install them anywhere that she found. Does anyone know what they could be used for? maybe for their connectivity and as switches?\n14. She is working part time and all that money goes towards paying for the mortgage.\n15. Out parents have passed and no one has much money on our side of the family to help her.\n\n\nWhy questions for you:\n\n1. What does a woman with no money do to get a divorce?\n2. These devices have to be illegal right? Is that okay in your own home? She had no knowledge of them.\n3. Does she call the cops next time he hurts her?\n4. Does she get a restraining order?\n5. What can she do?\n\nShe is always welcome to stay with me. She has a couple hundred dollars. Any advice or help would be appreciated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Go kick his ass END"}

All this is to say, you have no legal recourse against the bank unless they have signed something and are currently in breach of an agreement or other provision of the document.\n\nThe termination of the agreement is based on you, the buyer, giving notice of the blown financing.  There are likely other provisions in the purchase agreement giving the seller the right to receive the earnest money if closing does not occur on the closing date.  \n\nEither get a lawyer or talk to the seller about what you want to have happen here.

In *Byrne v. Avon Products,* 328 F.3d 379 (7th Cir.2003), this court held that either an employee's inability to communicate his illness to his employer or clear abnormalities in the employee's behavior may constitute constructive notice of a serious health condition. *Id.* at 381-82. **\"It is enough under the FMLA if the employer knows of the employee's need for leave; the employee need not mention the statute or demand its benefits.\"** ***Id.*** **at 382.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... Under the FMLA a covered employee may have up to twelve weeks of leave during any twelve month period if the employee is suffering from a **\"serious health condition\" which makes him \"unable to perform the functions of \\[his\\] position.\"** 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D); 29 C.F.R. § 825.114(a)(2)(i). A serious health condition is one which requires \"**inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility\" or continuing treatment by a health care provider**. 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). The continuing treatment test for a serious health condition is met if an employee is incapacitated by \"an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition\" for more than three consecutive days and for which he is treated by a health care provider on two or more occasions. 29 C.F.R. § 825.114(a)(2)(i).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... In order to benefit from the protections of the statute, an **employee must provide his employer with enough information to show that he may need FMLA leave.** *Thorson v. Gemini, Inc.,* 205 F.3d 370, 381 (8th Cir.2000) (quoting *Browning v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,* 178 F.3d 1043, 1049 (8th Cir.1999)); 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(c), 825.303(b).

NTN-Bower Corp.,* 272 F.3d 1006, 1009 (7th Cir.2001).

Being in an HOA is something that is reflected on the title\/deed. \n\nIf someone down the line says that your property actually does belong to an HOA, you can go to your title insurance company for relief. \n\nCreating an HOA is a lot more involved than just having a group of homeowners come together with an agreement. They have to draw up bylaws and covenants and, most importantly, the deeds would have to be amended to reflect this. \n\nThere have been a few posts here by folks where neighboring HOAs have tried to bully them into joining. They can request, coerce, plead, lie etc, but it's very unlikely they'd be able to successfully add your home to their organization without you first agreeing to it. END"}

She believes it. \n  \n\nMy sister has a 5 year old daughter whom we believe he has already been inappropriate with due to comments and actions she has made. \n\nMy niece's father and his wife are trying every legal option they can to keep my niece from harm as they are domiciliary guardians, but the new judge is still allowing my sister overnight visits every other weekend and a one week visit for a trip out of state. \n\nWe have inside information from someone who used to be my sister's friend but started reporting what she saw and heard while with my sister, to my niece's father and wife. Reports such as:\n\n-the sex offender is living with my sister (which was not allowed by the previous judge, he told her that she may not have her daughter around any male she is dating) they are lying to everyone saying he doesn't live there but over the course of two months they have pictures of his vehicle parked outside at 10pm and 6am nearly every day. \n\n-my sister plans on taking my niece to Texas (we are in Louisiana) and not coming back. She said that multiple times and has been actively seeking employment in the area where she plans on going. \n\n-my sister has allowed the sex offender to give my niece baths \n\n-they all sleep in the same bed\n\n---------------\n\nWe are poor. \nThe lawyer wants a 5k retainer to open a new case and my niece's father just spent his savings with the custody battle. \n\nWhat can they do to protect my niece? The judge told them that as long as the sex offender is not there when my sister has her visitations, then there is no problem. My sister WILL HAVE HIM THERE. She is a liar with no morals and lives a disgusting lifestyle. \n\nI let my sister live with me for 4 years because I wanted to give her time to get on her feet and be able to take care of her daughter alone. In 4 years she never kept more than a part time job. She didn't pay bills and only contributed to the groceries with part of her food stamps. She lived like a slob and destroyed the FREE room we gave her. She didn't help with any chores. She ignored my niece and yelled at her when she was upset. Due to my own health and stress I made her move out and live with our mother ( next door to us). I still took care of my niece every day until her father stepped in and took my sister to court for full custody. \n\nIt kills me to talk about my own sister this way but it is the truth. The evidence is there, she is a selfish person who mistreats her daughter and constantly puts her in harm's way. \n\nEvey time my niece's father finds new evidence that my sister isn't following the rules he reports it but nothing is being done. \n\nWhat can they do to save my niece from being assaulted by this man? \n\nPlease please help us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm a Louisiana lawyer (I can message the mods with proof if need be) but I'm not your lawyer. I have some experience with family law, but it was a few years ago. \n\n1) Gonna reiterate everyone else's suggestion that you call DFCS, the Department of Children and Family Services (Louisiana's version of CPS). They have a child abuse hotline. They need to know about the baths and the fact that they all sleep in the same bed. \n\n2) The judge is probably letting your sister continue to have overnight visits because your niece's dad hasn't yet asked to amend their custody agreement (or he has asked\/filed a motion to amend it, but the judge hasn't ruled on it yet). This could be tricky depending on which part of LA you're in; not all courts are open yet. I know a few judges are still managing their dockets remotely but I have no idea how they're managing that in family courts. \n\n3) Just because yall have been telling everyone that the sex offender is living there doesn't mean the court actually knows that. You say your neice's father \"reports\" everything, but what exactly do you mean by that? Who does he report it to? I clerked for a judge for a few years and can tell you that we'd get calls allllll the time from pro se litigants (people representing themselves) who wanted to complain about something in their case. Even if they have the best complaint in the world, the judge can't really do anything about if you don't file a motion to ask the court to do something and include some supporting evidence. I'd be happy to explain this in more detail if you'd like. \n\n4) Again, it's very important to have physical proof that he's living there (multiple time-stamped pictures of his car in the driveway would be a good start) and your niece's father needs to show that to the court (or have his attorney do it). Even better if you can get pictures of his car there when she has visitation. Witness testimony is OK, but physical proof is better. It can also make cases get heard more quickly- sometimes a hearing will have to be pushed back to another date if you need witness testimony, because they have to make sure they set the hearing on a date when everyone can attend. \n\n5) The fact that your sister is planning on moving to Texas and not returning is really important. You need to make sure that your niece's father knows that and that he tells the court (or that his attorney tells the court). From what I remember, a parent planning to leave the state without informing the court\/the other parent was treated as a big deal by family court judges. \n\n6) I think it's against this sub's rules to recommend any legal services, but I'm not sure if that applies to legal aid services since some of them are quasi-governmental (mods: please let me know if you consider this to be against the rules and I'll edit this part out). At any rate, I can tell you with certainty that there are legal aid clinics in Louisiana that will take custody cases for low-income people if your niece's father meets the income requirements. He'll have to apply; you can't do it for him since you're not the parent. And he'll probably have to pay for the filing costs since they usually can't cover that, but it'll hopefully only be a few hundred dollars max vs. thousands if you hired a private attorney. END"}

What legal grounds do I have?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Spraying is not an effective treatment for bedbugs, as they can retreat into the walls and avoid the spray. If you only treat one unit, they will escape into the other one. They breed incredibly fast and once they have had a blood meal, they can survive for months without another one. The only way to ensure that you don't just keep passing them back and forth is to heat treat the entire unit. You need to convince your landlord to do this. Downstairs neighbor should have no objections because it doesn't involve chemicals, but it is a pain in the butt (you will need to remove anything that can melt or that would be damaged by heat from the house and the process takes several hours). Your landlord can either keep paying to have an ineffective treatment again and again, or they can spring for the effective treatment, which hopefully you should only have to do once (although sometimes they have to come back more than once). \n\nHowever, since your landlord is technically paying to have the situation resolved, as long as they keep paying every time you find the bugs, there isn't much you can sue them for. They are taking steps to resolve the situation, even if they aren't 100% effective steps. Your best course of action is to reason with them. If you send them evidence that the infestation persists and they refuse to pay for another treatment, then you may have a case, so keep documenting and sending them notice in writing every time you find a bedbug.  You can contact the health department to put pressure on your landlord to remedy the situation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Insect infestations are a public nuisance in Cleveland health and safety codes. The health department considers bed bugs to be an insect infestation. They will inspect and issue orders to landlords to treat infestations.**\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.ohhn.org\/bedbugbasics\/) END"}

I know, in WA for example, evictions can and will still be processed for lease violations impacting the health and safety of other residents\/neighbors. I’m pretty sure bed bugs would qualify!  \n  \nThis said, it would be on your landlord to enforce. You can’t compel him to unless there’s language in your lease (there’s usually not).  \n  \nYour recourse, as shitty as it is, is to move. You could probably get out of your lease. You may be able to go after LL for losses.  \n  \nMaybe there’s some regulatory body you could complain to directly so that they could pursue both the LL and neighbor? Depends on where you are.\n  \nYou may also have some relevant coverage if you have a good renter’s policy. For example, it may pay for a few days in a hotel if you’ve been displaced. END"}

When i was 9 -10 yrs old, my moms boyfriend sexually assaulted me , I didn’t realize it at the time . A year later he tried again and also attempted to seduce me and i knew something was wrong . I told my mom and she said it was my decision if i wanted him in the house or not but she also said that he’s the only man in the house and that we need a man to protect us . I knew he made her happy so i said he can stay . After that I never talked to him and i always make sure to keep my distance . I am now 15. Yesterday I was at a friends house (who lives one house away from me) when my younger brother texted me that my mom and her bf had an argument , my mom told my brother to stay away from the boyfriend bc he was crazy . I started asking him questions asking if the boyfriend was drunk ( he drinks ) and if my mom was crying or anything , he didn’t have the answers to my questions and he said my mom was in her room . He also said that my moms boyfriend was outside in the dark . Then he texted me saying that the power shut off . I got worried so i called my older brother who lives with us and asked him what’s happening, he said that the power just went out , then i asked about our mom and he didn’t know that my mom and her bf had argued and that he would go check on her . We ended the call , then my little brother texted me saying that my older brother was telling my mom to open her room door but she wasn’t responding . That’s when i ran home and when i went in my older brother and his girlfriend were coming down the stairs asking me where’s mom and that they were banging on her door and the boyfriend had opened it saying that he didn’t know where she was . i told them that i didn’t know , we went to the garage and she was sleeping in her car and we were explaining to her that it isn’t right that she’s sleeping in the car , it’s her home and if he’s making her feel unsafe then he needs to sleep in the garage or leave . We all then went upstairs and my older brother was telling the boyfriend that he needs to leave . The boyfriend refused and got upset telling him that he’d not leaving and that my brother needs to leave . He then started beating up my brother very badly , my brothers girlfriend started tasing him but it wasn’t working to stop him .

{"prompt":" Q: My moms boyfriend sexually assaulted me , i’m a minor .\nT: GOOD\nB: Hello i’m sorry . I would’ve posted this on the sexualassault thread but it doesn’t look active . When i was 9 -10 yrs old, my moms boyfriend sexually assaulted me , I didn’t realize it at the time . A year later he tried again and also attempted to seduce me and i knew something was wrong . I told my mom and she said it was my decision if i wanted him in the house or not but she also said that he’s the only man in the house and that we need a man to protect us . I knew he made her happy so i said he can stay . After that I never talked to him and i always make sure to keep my distance . I am now 15. Yesterday I was at a friends house (who lives one house away from me) when my younger brother texted me that my mom and her bf had an argument , my mom told my brother to stay away from the boyfriend bc he was crazy . I started asking him questions asking if the boyfriend was drunk ( he drinks ) and if my mom was crying or anything , he didn’t have the answers to my questions and he said my mom was in her room . He also said that my moms boyfriend was outside in the dark . Then he texted me saying that the power shut off . I got worried so i called my older brother who lives with us and asked him what’s happening, he said that the power just went out , then i asked about our mom and he didn’t know that my mom and her bf had argued and that he would go check on her . We ended the call , then my little brother texted me saying that my older brother was telling my mom to open her room door but she wasn’t responding . That’s when i ran home and when i went in my older brother and his girlfriend were coming down the stairs asking me where’s mom and that they were banging on her door and the boyfriend had opened it saying that he didn’t know where she was . i told them that i didn’t know , we went to the garage and she was sleeping in her car and we were explaining to her that it isn’t right that she’s sleeping in the car , it’s her home and if he’s making her feel unsafe then he needs to sleep in the garage or leave . We all then went upstairs and my older brother was telling the boyfriend that he needs to leave . The boyfriend refused and got upset telling him that he’d not leaving and that my brother needs to leave .

If he's sued for any reason, his undivided 1\/3 interest in your home could be seized by a judgment creditor. If he files bankruptcy his interest can be subject to seizure by a trustee.\n\nThe optimal way for this to have been handled would have been for a promissory note or a second mortgage (which would have alerted your lender to the loan, which is why you didn't do this) to have secured his interest *and only his interest*. That ship is sailed. Can you just save up cash as quickly as possible (or do a cash-out refinance), buy him out, and have a new deed executed that takes him off the deed? That would probably be the cleanest way forward. \n\nIf that isn't an option, you should speak to an attorney have have a real contract drafted up that specific establishes the rights and responsibilities of all parties. Failure to do this means that upon sale, he's getting a check at closing. END"}

Did they say, \"Sorry we entered in the information wrong,\"  \"We made a bad managerial decision, \" or was it more along the lines that they claimed the insurance agreement meant they did not have to insure you until your condition became severe enough.

{"prompt":" Q: Was fired from my company less than 24 hours after disclosing my pregnancy to HR.\nT: GOOD\nB: Sorry if this is kind of long! I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.\n\nI've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO\/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our \"HR\" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.\n\nDecember came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.\n\nThe company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss\/ceo\/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.\n\nUnrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.\n\nI have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.\n\nMy review was with our CEO\/owner and our \"HR\" yesterday. He essentially leads the entire meeting, telling me that I was a great find for the company, came at just the right time when I did (called me a \"miracle\"), and then proceeds to say that my role is has not become what he wanted it to be and rather than letting me go back to my old position, they are going to \"phase me out\". This was a confusing way of putting it because they told me that was my last day, not to come in next week, but they would pay me for two more weeks of work in addition to what I'm owed for hours worked in January. He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else. Our HR person chimes in to say that if i want to come in for a lunch to \"honor me\" they can arrange for that. The ceo\/owner tells me that I probably have a lot of questions, but he says he doesn't want me to ask any of them now and that I can call\/email him later with any questions or concerns that I may have. The whole thing felt very weird to me, but I was also very emotional and visibly upset.\n\nThis whole thing has me shocked and extremely scared. Even if I find another job right away, I will not qualify for FMLA once our baby arrives and it seems most places have a 1 year policy before maternity leave kicks in anyways. At this point I'm trying to figure out what my legal rights are. I'm in Oregon, so I know I'm in an \"at will\" state or whatever it's called. Does anyone have any advice on whether or not there's enough info here to pursue anything against my previous employer? I've filed for unemployment, and I'm actively searching for jobs but there's not much available in my field in my city at the moment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The [Pregnancy Discrimination Act](http:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/laws\/statutes\/pregnancy.cfm) makes it illegal for any employer in the U.S. with 15 or more workers to treat employees unfairly because they are pregnant. That means:\n\nYour boss can’t fire you or cut your hours when she finds out that you’re pregnant—you have the right to keep working as long as you can still do your job. You also have the right to be free from harassment at work because you are pregnant.\n\nYou cannot be asked about your pregnancy or plans to have children in a job interview.\n\nYour employer can’t treat you differently from other workers just because you are pregnant. The Supreme Court just decided a case where they clarified what this means. The Court said that employers may not put a “significant burden” on pregnant employees. How do you know what’s a significant burden? Start looking around at how your employer treats other non-pregnant employees who have needed an accommodation at work. For example, does your employer have a policy of giving light duty only to those with on-the-job injuries? Or did they have no problem helping out folks with non-pregnancy related disabilities, but sent all the pregnant women out onto unpaid leave? If so, this could be evidence of pregnancy discrimination. Since we are still waiting for further clarification of how this standard works, it’s best to collect all the evidence you can (policies, employee handbooks or manuals, digging around to find out how others have been treated) and to discuss your particular situation with an attorney.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/babygate.abetterbalance.org\/oregon\/ END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Was fired from my company less than 24 hours after disclosing my pregnancy to HR.\nT: GOOD\nB: Sorry if this is kind of long! I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.\n\nI've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO\/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our \"HR\" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.\n\nDecember came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.\n\nThe company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd.

I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12\/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9\/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended.

Bit of a back story here but \n\nA few years ago, my dad was arrested for some pretty serious crimes and was bailed out a few days after. As I was a minor then, I was taken by CPS and sent to live with my mom and stepdad. During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. \n\nHe took all of his stuff and any thing I didn’t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn’t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)\n\nHis dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he’d stop paying it. That’s fine with me as I have no contact with my dad and have been meaning to cut my name off his stuff but hey, life happens. I decided recently that I’d go through it and get my stuff and just let the storage place auction the rest. Opened it up after not seeing it in years, and there’s two firearms. \n\nThere’s no telling if they’re registered (I’m pretty sure he bought them off Craigslist or something similar) or even legal in any capacity. One is a pistol and another is some kind of automatic rifle. Not sure. Don’t know much about guns. I didn’t touch them or the bullet cartridges with them. My sister was with me and touched them to see if they were real. \n\nI closed it, locked it, and called my stepdad to ask what to do. He told me to tell the people that own the units, my mom says go to police since my dad is technically a felon (he’s still in prison for another decade plus) and my sister (paranoid ex drug addict) says we should just leave them and I need to forget my stuff in there because “the cops will make it look like we own them illegally” (taking that with a grain of salt)\n\nSo.

After a quick examination, the OBGYN determined that she suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and was experiencing internal bleeding. She was rushed into surgery within the hour to save her life. \n\nFortunately, she has recovered since the incident however we are still strapped with medical debt from both ER visits, the OBGYN and the surgery. It’s not that we’re opposed to paying for the services but feel as if we are entitled to some reprieve and even compensation , given the two missed diagnosis and the almost fatal fallout from them. \n\nIs there any possibility that we have a case against the hospital or at least legs to stand on to ask for a reprieve from the charges?\n\nWe are located in Richmond, Virginia. \n\nThank you for reading, please let me know if any additional information is needed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You would have to demonstrate that the misdiagnosis was unreasonable.

You generally prove this through expert evidence.\n\nThe other issue is what injuries they caused you. You mention the ER debt, the OBGYN, and the surgery. Even if the ER doctor(s) did misdiagnose her, they may not have caused her to have to see an OBGYN and have surgery. That may very well have happened anyway (i.e. had the first ER doctor picked up on the ectopic pregnancy, she still may have incurred those OBGYN\/surgery costs). You may be able to prove that had the first doctor caught it, you could have taken medication to end the pregnancy rather than requiring surgery, but this option may not have been available in your case (in other words, she still may have required surgery). In short, you aren't going to get money for health care costs that you would have incurred anyway to treat the ectopic pregnancy. However, if you are able to argue that the first ER doctor was unreasonable in failing to diagnose her condition, you may be able to recover the cost of the second ER visit (because it would have been unnecessary had the first doctor properly identified her condition).

Until an expert who knows where to look and what to look for has had a chance to clear the building, there is still a chance the snake is still in there.\n\nHowever, if there are at least two people there together, then you can still come in and do your job - so long as it doesn't involve blindly reaching into dark spaces. Someone else in the building isn't good enough because the second person needs to be there to watch your back while you're focussed on your job and to call an ambulance if you do get bitten.\n\nHowever, most snakes will actively avoid people, so if you were on your own and noisy, odds are you'd be able to work on your own without issue.\n\nThe sticking point is \"without reprimand\". If your boss is the type to make you go in to an area where a snake might be against your better judgement then odds are they're the type to try and write you up for not saying \"bless you\" after they sneezed.

I am not necessarily looking for answers about the ins and outs of the state pension system, but more for what legal liability my employer might have for the ramifications this is causing.  \n\nI am public school teacher in NJ.  I had 5 years of service before I started with my former school in early 2017. They took 15 months to complete the intrafund transfer with much pestering from me (already ridiculous.)  Inactive pension accounts expire after two years.  Right before this time period was up (June 2018) the transfer went through.  I received certification from the state that the transfer was completed with a date of March 2017 (so I was only actually inactive for 8 months) and that my deductions and 15 months of back deductions would begin in June 2018.  From that date on, the deductions were coming out of each paycheck, in the correct amounts, under line items clearly denoting pension contribution and back pension contribution. \n\nI left that school this past June and took a job at in a different district for September.  At that point, I thought my biggest issue was waiting for another transfer and making sure I was putting money aside for the 2 remaining back payments, plus the back payments i would have to make after the transfer went through.  In October, the payroll department alerted me to the fact that they were having difficulty because they couldn't find an account in my name.  It seems that even though I was making these contributions, the state wasn't receiving them.  My account expired.  The state most likely sent a notice to a previous address.  I have had to enroll in new account.  Expired accounts lose all rights and privileges connected to that account - I've lost my tier, my retirement is pushed back, and I would have to purchase 7.5 years of service credits at much higher rates.

After a few more weeks of radio silence, I tried to follow up by CCing a higher up, who CC'd other higher ups, and their replies make it clear they don't understand the situation at all.

Is this legal, I was a minor when it happened, so why would it go into my account or should I take some sort of legal action against the creditors. I'm sorry I don't know about this stuff due to only being 18 years old.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Dispute the charge with the credit agencies. As a minor your parents\/guardians should be the party financially responsible. END"}
{"prompt":" Q: Mother taken advantage of by travel agent for $50,000 (MN\/FL)\nT: GOOD\nB: In September of 2019, my mother and an old friend  she recently reconnected with who both live in Minnesota traveled to Spain and France for two weeks. My mother informed the travel agent she wanted to spend no more than between $6,000-$10,000 total for the trip. My Mother's friend agreed she didn't want to spend more than $5,000 for her portion. My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent. My mother was told the only expenses she would owe for their stays would be cleaning fees and that she would cover the security deposits. All other costs of the trip were to be equally split between my mother and her friend. \n\nAfter reviewing my Mother's accounts over Christmas, I realized a third-party company, on behalf of a travel agent my mother used, has charged my mother more than $50,000 total between her credit card and checking account beginning from before her trip, right up until the end of December. The travel agent is unable to provide invoices for the majority of the $50,000 charged to this third-party company. I was informed that because my mother’s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother’s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. \n\nThe travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. \n\nThe travel agent gained access to my mother’s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. \n\nThe travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.\n\nThe travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker\/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother’s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. \n\nI have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  \n\nMy main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? \n\nApologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. \n\nTL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances. The charges are being disputed via her bank, but the bank doesn't know if they will be refunded to my mother. What are her chances if she choses to civilly sue?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like the old friend colluded with the travel agency to take your mother for a ride (no pun intended).

It sounds like his PO is working with him to keep him within the conditions of his bail or probation by arranging for it to be replaced ASAP. \n\nI would gather also that there is possibly something interfering with the signal itself the device is sending or receiving.

Tell the PO that you believe the basement may be interfering with the GPS signal.

Talk with the PO as well, and if you know the name of the company who does the actual monitoring (I'm almost positive they've probably outsourced this), call them up and explain the problem you're having and see if you have any recourse as well.\n\nThe worst possible thing you can do is \"wait and see\" in this case. Be proactive. Answer every call from your PO. Change your sleeping area if possible to allow for better signal. If this ends up in front of a judge and you haven't been prompt or diligent about reporting issues or switching out of equipment, it will reflect badly on you.\n\nSo yeah, talk to PO, talk to your lawyer who handled or is handling your case and make them both aware of the difficulties you're having. Depending on the charges and conditions of your probation, they may try to change the conditions of your bail to account for the difficulties, but if not, this will probably be one of them \"grin and bear it\" moments in life.

Backstory: I'm 37 and recently married with no kids but my wife and I would like to start a family  soon.\n\nMy Dad (70) and Stepmom (55) just had a child (using in-vitro). It was a surprise to the rest of the family but clearly an intentional decision on their part.\n\nShe doesn't have any other family and my dad doesn't have any siblings. My brother (35) and I are his only family.   He keeps trying to tell me that I need to \"step up\" for the family and take guardianship of my new half-sister. But this seems like a pretty big decision given how old they both are.\n\nI love my father very much but he is not in great health and it's unlikely he will live until 88 when the child is of legal age. My stepmom is in better health but does not have great employment prospects so I'm worried that even if she lives, there wont be enough money.\n\nWhat exactly does guardianship entail legally and what can I do to protect myself before responding. They live in MD. We live in DC. I'm worried that this is pretty big ask to make to my wife at the start of our marriage. I haven't agreed to anything so welcome any and all advice and follow up questions.\n\nUpdate (for clarity): He's asked to take \"guardianship\" only if something happens to both of them, so not while they're both alive. But given their advanced age this feels like a possible scenario before the child turns 18.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" None of this story seems to make sense.  It’s hard to imagine a fertility clinic creating this pregnancy in these two people.  And almost impossible to imagine someone making the financial investment in IVF only to turn around and seek to immediately hand that child off to someone else.  \n\nWhat is it your father wants to accomplish?  Is it your assistance?  Or is it your raising the child as your own?  \n\nThere are a number of approaches you could take to giving care to your father’s child.  One could be you maintaining custodial care of that child without a change in parental rights.

I work 40+ hours a week consistently and in the summertime 50-60. I am a good manager, a good boss to my employees and I have been extremely loyal and reliable throughout my employment here. SO I am a salaried employee and I left town to go visit family for christmas. I was gone for 6 days. On my most recent paycheck, the owner (who controls all payroll) did not pay me my full salaried amount, the check was cut in half. He has never discussed any type of vacation policy and has never garnished my wages like this in the past. He did not mention that this would be occurring, I had no idea until I received my check. I live on a tight budget and to have 1\/4 of a month's wages to unexpectedly disappear is...just awful, especially after the holidays.\n\nSo I walked out. I packed up everything I had purchased with my own money and was never reimbursed for (mostly bar equipment), I collected everything on my office desk and left my work keys on the desk as I walked out. The entire time the owner just sat in the office and didn't say a word. He obviously knew what was happening. I feel so disrespected and under appreciated its unreal. 3 years and he does me dirty like that and then doesn't say a single word? Doesn't call? Text? Nothing? Just throws away arguably the most valuable employee in the business and for what? Because I have a family on christmas? Screw me right.\n\nSO I guess my question is, is he legally able to withhold half of my paycheck even though I am on salary? Even though I was gone 6 days I still worked at least one day of each week in the pay period. Can I file unemployment under these circumstances even though I quit? And technically I never said \"I quit\" I just walked out without saying anything. Any advice would be appreciated. Apologize for the mild rant, but F that man I'm so pissed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"An exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked\" Now that makes it sound like I should have been paid because I worked at least one day during each week of the pay period.

Getting a second opinion on whether or not the dentist\/oral surgeon did anything wrong that might have caused that would likely be one of the next steps. END"}

{"prompt":" Q: Girl has been cyberbullying\/harassing me for over a month. IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)\nT: GOOD\nB: Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!\n\nIt's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health\/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health\/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health\/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG.

{"prompt":" Q: Girl has been cyberbullying\/harassing me for over a month. IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)\nT: GOOD\nB: Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!\n\nIt's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health\/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health\/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health\/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. \n\nEverything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest.

Their instagram was actually private so I couldnt see anything. However, there was some bypassing site that displayed all the person's private posts and you could read all the comments too. This was being displayed on a 3rd website, not on IG, but I could tell it was of the person's actual pictures and comments because I know the person pretty well.

It would be hard to answer that from here.  \n\nAs u\/Selphis points out, that depends some on what interfering with your job means.  But it also looks at the fundamental defamation question - did she say things that she knew to be untrue, or did she say opinions and things she believed to be true when she said them.  \n\nIn general, in these kinds of statements, there would be much room for opinion or conclusions she reached even those they happened to be wrong.  A case might depend on *establishing with evidence* that she maliciously lied and not just that she was mistaken.  \n\nThe other question, and perhaps the even more likely reason that it would be unwise to sue here, is the impact that doing so might have on your custody case and on your ongoing coparenting arrangement (remember that very nearly *all* parents end up coparenting to some extent).  It's *likely* there isn't as much to gain here as there may be to lose, and your current attorney is the one to begin answering that question. END"}

I really need advice so if someone could please read my story I would really appreciate it.\n\nI live in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\nI needed to put my items in storage when I was planning on travelling Australia, so I asked my mom and stepdad to help me move out of my apartment and store my items and they offered to help me if I paid them something like $100 for the gas, I agreed (stepdad has a work truck). \nI had packed about half of everything and they came over and helped me pack the rest(along with my friends), I put all of my clothes into garbage bags (about 8-10 bags), we moved all my necessities (including mattress, duvet, duvet cover, desk, bed frame, everything I owned) into the work truck and I told them to just put all my stuff under their house in the basement. \n\nI was originally going to donate some bags of clothes but I didn't have enough time to sort through them so we donated some furniture (my couches) to the salvation army, they wouldn't accept one of them so my stepdad said he would go to the dump and throw it out. I told them I'd deal with everything else when I get back in a year or so (they have a lot of storage space).\n\n\n**Fast forward**: I had to come home early due to covid, so after about 30 hours of travel I arrive back in Canada to my parents house. I went under the house because I wanted to wear a big comfy sweater that I missed (I only brought a suitcase of summer clothes to Australia because I knew it would be much warmer there). I go under the house and can't find any bags of clothing... I ask my mom where she put them and she said \"I'm not sure, whatever isn't there was donated\". WHAT?? They never said they were going to donate anything, as I asked them to keep all the boxes and bags. I asked further and she said that my roommate told them they could be donated, I immediately messaged him and he said that he heard them joking about just donating the items when I left, and he said he chimed in and said that he himself got rid of all of his stuff and joked around with them. I told her that excuse was bullshit and they could have had any ANY type of communication with me and I would told them to NOT get rid of the items... \n\nMy mom then said that some of the boxes were ripped and the bags had holes in them so she got rid of them. I continued to search and couldn't find much of anything. They got rid of my duvet, mattress, both of my memory foams pillows, drawing books with all my drawing supplies, VR headset, Samsung galaxy s8+ (including photos and memories that I did NOT upload), 500$ headphones, Google nexus, iPod, Nintendo 3ds, stereo system, they were ALL GONE along with all my clothes. \n\nThey would not have sold my items (they aren't intelligent enough to figure out prices and sell them).

I am in 14 day isolation so I haven't been talking with my mother.

Do I tell them to repay me for all of the items or talk to a lawyer about this? I am so nervous about the talk tomorrow - My step dad is quite manipulative and gets rid of things that clog up space for him, and my mom is a push over and gets stressed at the smallest things and is very emotionally immature so tomorrow is going to be very difficult. \n\nI don't have any intention of talking to my parents ever again after this.

Sometimes they'll call it a \"cashier's check\", a \"certified check\", or a \"verified check\".\n\n&gt;You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account is not the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law.\n\n&gt;For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins.\n\n&gt;Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems. END"}

About three years ago, MIL's husband died, shortly after which she started corresponding with an individual who claims to be a member of the US Army. She transferred several sums of money to him at his request, and later had her bank account suspended and is unable to open a new one after receiving and depositing several fraudulent cheques with instructions to transfer the money after the deposit was made. Standard romance scam stuff, early on her daughters expressed concern to her about the individual, to which she asked the police for advice and was told that \"he seems a great guy\" or words to that effect. Since then she refuses to listen to any criticism.\n\nI've just discovered in the last few days that for some time she's been receiving regular letters from the individual's \"handler\" containing cheques with instructions to have them converted into bitcoin, apparently my wife and her sisters have been aware for a while but didn't feel the need to make me aware. Today she informed us that a parcel is going to be delivered to our house for another individual, which she's to hold onto until she receives further instructions.\n\nMy understanding is that we should report the situation to the federal authorities, but I'm also concerned whether there are any legal repercussions for my wife, her sisters, and I, regarding being accessories to the crime or what have you due to having been aware of it for some time and not having reported it sooner. Should we be looking to consult with a lawyer as to the best way to proceed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm in Pennsylvania\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Just popping in to recommend the Dr Phil episode about this scam - it can often reach older and\/or resistant adults because he can be seen as a 'trusted' figure, more so than maybe a family member even.

All the other homes go straight from the driveway to the street. All of the curbs (except for flat spot in front of garages) are painted red for fire lanes.
