This clerk states that she owes another $2,600 (now she's stating $6,500) when she has already paid $32,000 lol. She was the recipient of a grant and paid out of pocket in the first two years. In full. Not only does she have the paper work to back that up, but the paperwork this clerk sent her doesn't even account for all the money. There's something like $5,000 missing from their documents. My partner has all the paperwork so it's a joke that these people are trying this. The clerk repeatedly (we have recordings) requested my partner come in to discuss this in person AND stated if she came in the dentist could just finish the work. My partner declined because 1. Sketchy and 2. Coronavirus. She knows for a fact (via paperwork, receipts, and previous office clerks) that she owes no money and is certainly not going to risk entering the public for the uncertainty of actually receiving the implants.\n\nGets weirder:\n\nOver the years she developed a personal relationship with this guy because he did in fact save her life with the surgery he conducted prior to developing her implants. She has always contacted him via personal cell phone and has even had appointments off the books, like when the first office would be closed for the day, just so she could get the care she needed.\n\nYesterday her temporary bridge broke, which is a huge problem if it falls out of her mouth because she will be unable to eat or even speak. So, she texts her dentist this morning letting him know it broke and asks when she will be able to receive her permanents. He beats around the bush, claims he needs to install new temporaries instead of the permanents he claims to have with him, and states that she needs to COME IN, IN PERSON to discuss this \"cordially\" with the front desk clerk what she \"owes\" stating that \"he's just a contracted dentist and not aware of finances.\" Discuss what? Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something? This is, based on confirmed totals via bills, grants, receipts, etc. pretty clear that this is extortion.\n\nImportant points:\n\n\\-according to a previous employee of his, 7 other people are dealing with this. Unfinished services that were paid IN FULL.\n\n\\-his reviews on BBB also contain a multitude of people claiming he has done this to them as well.\n\n\\-there is zero proof that she actually owes money. no signed documents.\n\n\\-both he and his new clerk have repeatedly requested for her to come in, in person instead of discussing this via phone, email, etc.\n\n-both previous offices have confirmed that there was zero balance remaining.\n\n-the 2nd location has stated they had to stop allowing him to bring old patients in for unfinished work because it was having a financially negative effect on the company considering their services were already paid in full; therefore taking up appointment times for currently paying clients.\n\nIf you're reading this thank you so much for your time.

I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. \n\nI have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. \n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. \n\nIn December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): \n\n\"Jess, \nI want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. \n\nAt this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. \n\nL, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. \n\nAs always, she would love to see/hear from you.\"\n\n\nshe replied to that email a short time later with \"thank you for the update\". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. \n\nAfter coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. \n\nIn January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:\n\n\"Jess, \nI wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. \n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\" \n\nand then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:\n\n\"Jess, \nIn addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.\"\n\nShe replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. \n\nWe did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. \n\nFast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. \n\nI told her that unfortunately we didn't have any \"left\", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. \n\nA few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for \"failing to offer her our shared child's cremains\" and \"offering a used necklace\" and some other nonsense. \n\nI'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March).

I'm going to base my reply under the assumption that you were legally granted full custody.  I'm a former CPS worker in another state, that being said, there is some commonality of law for expedience and fairness that is generally universal.\n\n1) When a parent is granted full custody, that doesn't mean the other parents rights are modified.  \"Sole custody\" typically means one parent is legally removed (along with their rights to the child) from the child's life\\*\\*.  If this is true and you have sole, full custody, then the child's biological mother has no legal rights to anything pertaining to this child, even in death.  If you have a court order that says you are the child's only guardian, that's your golden ticket and no legal action will go further than you presenting that during a discovery phase, assuming she can find an attorney to take this at all.\n\n2) You have some type of written evidence that you offered the mother some of the child's ashes.  Based on my previous point, you are under no legal obligation to offer this woman anything.\n\n3) The fact that biological mother read it and changed her mind a month later doesn't change your legal duty to her.  Even if you're trying to give notice to another party (which you weren't obligated to do) any method that is believed to reasonably give notice is appropriate.  The fact that she replied to your email is proof that she read what you sent her and the nature of her reply says that she understood what you were asking her.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's assume that mother's legal rights to the child weren't modified other than allowing you to be the custodial parent.  Mother was notified about the child's remains and stated she didn't want them and you did with them as you saw fit.  Did the child herself make any statements as to what she wanted done with her ashes?  Even if she did, as a minor, you would have final say.  \n\n\nA lawyer is in the business of taking cases they can win.  Let her pay an attorney and let them turn her down.  Don't throw money at this, it'll set a bad precedent going forward.  \n\n\\*\\* Unless you're a tribal family and covered by ICWA.

On Wednesday evening, I checked my bank balance on my app, and I saw that I had a negative balance. I'm not well-off by any means, but I have NEVER overdrawn my account or even incurred a maintenance fee for having less than the required balance. I saw that there had been a withdrawal for $2,000, and then a transfer of over $1,000 from my savings account to my checking account. I feared that I'd been hacked, so I immediately changed my passwords and called the bank. \n\nWhen I called the bank, they explained what happened, and I have to say that I've never heard anything like it. My father is joint on my account because I had lived abroad, and he had given me money for a visa. I wanted him to be able to access that money, so I put him on my account and just never took him off. I will say (because the bank tried blaming it on him) that my father would NEVER touch my money. He would be mortified if he thought this was at all his fault. \n\nApparently, my father cashed a check at TD for $2,000. The teller was new, and instead of removing the money from the person who wrote the check (it was a TD check), she cashed the check against MY account. After calling the bank, they assured me that this was a normal thing to do if the check wasn't a TD check (which it was), because how would they know if the check written was \"good\" or not? Until the check cleared with the other institution, it is completely normal for *any* bank to cash against the account of the person the check is written *to*, not *from.* And, as my father doesn't have his own account at TD, it came out of mine, because he is joint on the account.\n\nApparently, the teller saw that I didn't have $2,000 in my checking account (because who does?), and instead of overdrawing my account, transferred exactly enough money from my savings to cover the check. Now, my father is *not* on my savings account. He should not have access to that money. Even if cashing against my account was the right move (which, I don't see how that's legal in any situation), she should *never* have touched my savings account. \n\nObviously, I can't go into a branch right now due to COVID-19.

Whether they need the hold or not, is it possible this particular account has a blanket hold on all cheques? (As an aside, does the bank not take the clearing period to actually check if any of the cheques are counterfeit or do anything like that even if it is on their own bank?)\n\nFor people who can't follow, Dad cashed a cheque. If it's an outside cheque, the bank can't immediately verify there is money to pay the cheque (because the banking system hasn't caught up to the internet), so if you deposit the cheque, there is a hold that you can't use that amount of money until the cheque clears. It will show on your balance, but you can only take out anything up to that amount.\n\nIf you want to cash the cheque out, they basically do the same transaction. You currently have a chequing balance of $3k. You cashed a $2k cheque. Here's the cash, but we're holding $2k in your account until the cheque clears - or in other words, they are putting the $2k on hold in your account and letting you take out $2k of your existing money.\n\nOP didn't have $2k in their account to take out, so the teller apparently took $1k from savings to top up the chequing.\n\nSo that implies to me that Dad got $2k from the cheque, and OP's account was topped up to $2k so there was $2k in it to hold until the cheque cleared. Assuming the cheque did clear, I'm not sure why OP would be out any money. They would just have $1k in the wrong account and there might be a temporary hold on it.\n\nOP didn't say anything about NSF.  OP's chequing account should not have been in the negative in gross balance, but might have had no unheld funds to pay bills resulting in an overdraw.\n\nOnce the cheque clears, OP should be whole other than any damages (fees or interest or otherwise) from the overdraw.\n\nIf the overdraw OP mentions was on the savings account, it would be odd because people don't usually run transactions out of their savings.\n\nIf the teller really did not tell Dad what they were doing, they should absolutely cover any of those damages. But again, you shouldn't be out $2k unless the cheque bounced - did it?\n\nThe teller should not have been able to deal with your savings account on your dad's instructions because he is not named. That is a breach by the bank, but also query what damages actually resulted from it that can't be undone.\n\n**Edit/TL/DR: OP is using the phrase that the cheque was \"cashed against\" their account. The most logical explanation to me is that OP is trying to pass on the bank's explanation that until they clear the cheque and verify there are funds to pay the cheque, they put a HOLD against the account of the payee (recipient). It is temprary. They are not cashing the cheque AGAINST your account. They are basically saying \"cash it at your own risk - if there isn't money to pay the cheque after the hold period, the money you just took out is coming from your own current balance. That's why there has to be enough balance there for your to withdraw the money.  In this case, OP's account is also the dad's account, in name. OP should only be out money if the cheque doesn't clear.

Sexual harrassment certainly falls under harrassment. A pattern of unwanted sexual advances certainly qualifies as a pattern of behavior which might reasonably cause substantial emotional distress..  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Edit: the specific statute I cited is Massachusetts General Laws Part IV, Title 1, Chapter 265, Section 43A\n\nThe OP identifies two specific instances of conduct: he struck her, and he offered a massage. Two is not a pattern or series within the meaning of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A in Massachusetts. \n\n*Commonwealth v. Welch*, 444 Mass. 80 (Mass. Supreme Jud. Ct 2005):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We determine today that the phrase \"pattern of conduct or series of acts\" requires the Commonwealth to prove three or more incidents of harassment for the following reasons. \n\nThat same case is instructive about why the mentions of the waitress stroy would likely not qualify as additional incidents (Ibid at 98, internal citations in the below are omitted for readability):  \n\n\n&gt;However, in crafting the criminal harassment statute, the Legislature appears to have had these constitutional limitations in mind. Rather than imposing an unduly broad prohibition on all annoying or offensive speech, the Legislature more narrowly drafted the criminal harassment statute. By its terms, the statute applies only to harassment that is (1) \"willful\\[\\]\" and \"malicious\\[\\]\"; (2) a \"pattern\" or \"series\" (which we construe to mean at least three acts); (3) \"directed at a specific person\"; (4) causes \"serious\\[\\] alarm \\[to\\] that person\"; and (5) \"would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.\" . . . To the extent the statute implicates harassing speech, it appears intended to reach primarily what would be considered \"fighting words.\" For example, the requirement that the harassment must be \"directed at specific persons\" comports with the rule that where words are not \"directed to the person of the hearer\" and \"\\[n\\]o individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably . . . regard\\[\\] the words . . . as a direct personal insult,\" even offensive words are not \"fighting words.\" . . . This court has similarly recognized that \"\\[i\\]n order to be personally abusive \\[i.e., \"fighting words,\"\\] the words must be \\`directed to the person of the hearer' in the sense that they are a face to face personal insult.\"\n\nThere doesn't seem to be much doubt that repeating even an embarrassing story about being mistaken for a girlfriend would not meet that level of harassing pure speech.   \n\n\nSo I have to ask, u/Ghawk134, if you read this case, or any case in Massachusetts construing G.

They'll come check it out. Keep reporting the abuse to animal control if they don't do anything. Sometimes it takes many complaints and incidents before they're able to do anything. You should also report the verbal assault by your neighbors. Next thing is that whenever their dogs are barking excessively, report this as a noise violation. In most places, a dog barking for at least 10-15 minutes straight is a noise violation, and grounds for a warning or ticket. As others have said, depending on the regulations where you live, you may be able to report the feces as a violation, and also they may not be able to have a \"kennel\" without a license.

That's unusual and, honestly, stupid.  Attorneys are typically looking for the deep pocket - the one who has the ability to pay.  That isn't you.

Make sure the letter gets into the right hands in terms of management so they can send it to their liability insurer.  They will handle  it from there.\n\nIf you get served with actual papers at some point, do the same - turn it over to the liability insurer.  In that case, I would recommend that you not let someone else handle it.  I would recommend you get the name and contact information for the insurance company so you can directly contact them.\n\nIt is extremely important that you understand that this is not on you, but on your employer.  They have insurance exactly for this situation.  You do not need to personally find and pay for an attorney.  You do not need legal aid.

If this is the case, your company's attorney(s) will take the matter up with the customer's attorney to determine a settlement, and if they can't come to an agreement, court. \n\nBut again, this is a process that will be handled by the company.

But the lawsuit would be against the store.  They sometimes name the employee, too, but, again, since you were acting in the course and scope of your employment, you would be covered by the store itself.  It's called vicarious liability (or respondeat superior).  It means that the store is responsible for your (alleged) negligence because you were an employee doing your job and it was your \"negligence\" in doing your job that led to their client's injury.

General liability insurance adjuster here. Best route from our perspective is to report that letter to your company's GL carrier.

Reporting it to the GL carrier will allow them to look at the language of your company's policy and determine if there is coverage for this incident. Again, I can only speak generally, but on its face this is a pretty standard slip-and-fall claim. Even if they continue to demand things of you personally, so long as this happened based on your work responsibilities, it should fall under your company's policy. If you want to be abundantly cautious you *could* also report it to your personal insurance carrier (homeowners or renters insurance).

Based in NYC*\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is \u201cold\u201d with medical issues, he said there\u2019s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.\n\nWe have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn\u2019t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.\n\nThe next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we\u2019d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their \u201csafety\u201d. \n\nSo we\u2019ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our \u201cloud talking\u201d at night.\n\nMy question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused.

What do I do?", "body": "I live in New York City.\nMy sons mother abandoned my son. I got a phone call from ACS one day and the ACS worker informed me that my sons mother wanted to give my son up because she couldn\u2019t handle him anymore. (my son has autism) The ACS worker asked me if I was interested in taking custody of my son. I said yes and we arranged for everything to happen that weekend. I signed papers and was told I had custody of my son. I didn\u2019t know any better so while I was still receiving letters claiming that I owed child support I thought nothing of it and thought the paper work was slow to catch up. I thought the same with his SSI checks when the ACS worker told me she told his mother that she had to go report that she was no longer the payer for my child. (No ssi checks for 3 months until I personally went over to see what was going on and found out she was still receiving the checks for him and still cashing them).\n His mother disappears off the face of the earth for literally 2 years. When she does pop back up she says she wants visitations. We go to court and that\u2019s when I find out I didn\u2019t really have \u201cfull custody\u201d in their eyes because the paper work was from an ACS worker. But His mother didn\u2019t dispute it. She said I could have full custody, she just as wants to see him once in awhile. We get through that, I\u2019m told nothing about the ssi money she practically stole and gave him none of although I asked about it and even said it in court. I also told my lawyer(public defendant)about the child support issue.I\u2019m being charged arrears and monthly fees for two years now. He said it would be in the final judgement yet the court papers I received do not state this and the public defendant no longer answers my calls.(side note: I lost my job and a lot of other things once I became a full time father. Autism isn\u2019t easy, my son had a difficult time living with his mother his first 8 years. He wasn\u2019t provided any help from city services or even special education because his mother didn\u2019t find the time to get him the help he needed. No therapy, no nothing. Thankfully I was able to find the time to get him all the help and resources he needs but lost my job in the process. I\u2019ve received a lot of help from my blessed mother but she can only do so much.)\n\nmy question(s)\n\n(apologies for the deep backstory)\n\nHow do I stop child support from sending me letters stating I owe them money for a child I am in full possession of?\nDo I still have to pay the arrears I\u2019m being charged despite him being in my full possession during that time?\nHas his mother still been receiving child support payments all this time (2 yrs) and if so what can I do about this? The IRS garnished my taxes last year despite him being in my custody? Did she receive a payment from that? Do I get this money back?\nWhat can I do about the money she stole from my son\u2019s SSI account?

Lots of cul-de-sacs and single family homes, very little access to major roads.  We had two dogs, both black with white and brown coloring on their chest and faces.  One long hair and one short.  My wife was heading outside to do check the weather to prep for some gardening around 11AM on Saturday 4/11, and neglected to fully latch the door.  The dogs pushed the door open and bolted.  Both are very fast, she ran inside to get her coat and shouted for me.  The dogs ran about a block and turned left, where we couldn't see.  When she got back outside, maybe a minute later, she found one dog coming home, more slowly, when he froze and collapsed about one house away.  I managed to catch the other one with the help of a neighbor about a block further away.\n\nWe got the dog home, and he was immobile, and struggling to breathe.  He's an older dog, around 11, and the other is around 3.  We thought at first that he was struggling to keep up with the younger dog or he was hit by a car, and the adrenaline got him halfway home, until we noticed a little bit of blood on his paw.  We took him to an emergency vet, they treated him for shock and x-rayed him, and found what appeared to be a pellet lodged in his abdomen, they also found the entrance wound.  He expired about two hours later.\n\nWe called the county dog warden, and posted to NextDoor (a local social networking app) asking for information.  The Deputy took our statement and the veterinarian information, and began  questioning witnesses.  Someone reached out on NextDoor the next day to report seeing it happen.  They saw two dogs in a neighbors front yard, heard a loud noise, one of the dogs yelped, and saw two men walk out of the garage facing that front yard a few moments later.  We gave their information to the Deputy, and he took a statement.  The Deputy tells us that because nobody saw a weapon or the specific act, and the folks who \"were implicated would not come forward\" he can't move ahead with charges.  The location that the witness claims to have seen the dogs matches the timeline, and location of the dog when he collapsed.\n\nMy Questions:  \n1) Given the existing evidence, is it even worth pursuing a civil case in small claims for veterinary bills and replacement costs for the dog? (Roughly 1100 in medical bills plus some nominal amount for replacement)  \n2) If yes, what are the steps involved in collecting the statement from the neighbor?\n\nFor Example:  \n a) Should we get a signed statement?    \n b) Would it be admissible in small claims court without the witness being present?  \n c) Should we have it notarized?  \n3) Should we hold off on a civil case, and continue to escalate the criminal case with the proper authorities?  \n\n\nThank you for your advice.", "score": 59, "comments": [{"id": "fn84jfx", "body": "Very sorry for your loss and that you have to live with the crazy neighbor going forward.

Additionally, the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog is liable in damages for any injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the dog if the injury, death, or loss was caused to the person or property of an individual who, at the time of the injury, death, or loss, was on the property of the owner, keeper, or harborer solely for the purpose of engaging in door-to-door sales or other solicitations regardless of whether the individual was in compliance with any requirement to obtain a permit or license to engage in door-to-door sales or other solicitations established by the political subdivision in which the property of the owner, keeper, or harborer is located, provided that the person was not committing a criminal offense other than a minor misdemeanor or was not teasing, tormenting, or abusing the dog.\n\nE", "score": 1}, {"id": "fn852zv", "body": "Thank you for your response.

It's your child's money and she can't use it for personal gain.\n\nBiological paternity is irrelevant. I don't want to pry into the particulars of your situation past where you're comfortable, but if you were married to the other biological parent at the time of/immediately prior to birth, signed a birth certificate, or signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, you're the legal father. \n\nUTMAs aren't conditional. Once money is transferred, it's transferred. Attorneys are free to send demand letters for any reason (I wouldn't send one in this circumstance, since I find it to be morally repugnant, but that's on the lawyer). They can't compel a paternity test without a court order. \n\nKeep in mind that Idaho does recognize grandparent rights for visitation. That said, your child's old enough that a court is unlikely to force him to visit the grandparents. If you need to go no contact or give them a time out, that'd be a reasonable thing to do.

My brother and his girlfriend came to visit us and our kids for the first time since quarantine began (they've been isolating entirely and so have we, we decided to take the slight risk to finally see family for a day). Normally, we keep our doors locked, but this time we left the front door unlocked for a bit after they arrived. My brother and I are both big dudes, so I feel pretty comfortable having the door unlocked for an hour or so. After a bit, we were all hanging out in the rear of the house (the front door opens to a short hallway next to the stairs) talking, and nothing is amiss. At one point, my wife noticed the front door was cracked open. We assumed my brother hadn't quite closed it all the way. She poked her head out to make sure our cat hadn't run out, and noticed a man we've never seen in our neighborhood before, just sitting in his car right across the street from our house, looking at her. She gave him a weird look and closed and locked the door. \n\nA HALF HOUR LATER, it's time for our youngest to take a nap (he's 2). She gets him up for a piggy-back ride upstairs, and as soon as she gets upstairs she starts absolutely screaming \"There's someone in our house!\" Apparently some guy was in our nursery, just sitting in my wife's rocking chair. So while my brother ran upstairs, I grabbed a weapon. My brother physically forced the man downstairs and out of the house, and when we tried to get him to stop and sit down, he just wanders off. Didn't run, didn't speak, just slowly walked off in a daze. The man across the street starts yelling \"It's okay, he's with me,\" etc. and between the confusion of that, and the fact that we don't want to be grappling with strangers during a pandemic, we didn't restrain the man. Probably should have, but we were all just shocked. \n\nAs the intruder wanders down the street, the other man starts telling us that they're from a group home in the area, and he's the guy's 'caretaker' or something. He said he was with him, WATCHING HIM TRY OTHER HOUSES in the neighborhood. He won't give us a reason why he didn't stop the guy, or call the police. Something about \"I thought he knew someone around here\" was the best we could do, but his accent made it difficult to understand everything. He just didn't seem concerned at all about the fact that a man, who was apparently in his care, had just let himself into a stranger's home during a pandemic, and hung out inside for a half hour.\n\nUltimately, the police came and got all our information, and after a bit of a search, they did find the man and take him into custody, thankfully. The guy seemed to be pretty out of it, we couldn't tell if he was extremely drugged up or just really mentally incompetent, but the caretaker told us he was 'psychotic' so that makes me feel even worse. I suppose, as home invasions go, we're thankful that this was an ultimately benign incident, but we sure won't feel right for a while. Obviously we'll be more vigilant about locked doors going forward, and the odds of this are pretty minimal, but I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. (Yes, we fully disinfected the kids' room immediately)\n\nMy plans are: Get the name of the group home and speak with them directly. I want assurances that his 'caretaker' is fired, at least. I'd also like to press charges against the caretaker, if possible. Any functioning adult should have known that what was happening was wrong and done something other than sit outside and twiddle their fucking thumbs. I'm not sure charges against the intruder are very useful, if he's mentally incompetent. I'm also curious about whether a restraining order is a good option? I've contacted the police and requested some follow-up, and was told that tickets were issues, but I'm not sure how much that means. We're in Michigan, btw. Is there anything else I should be doing? Sorry for the wall of text, but this was just such a weird incident, I wanted to get it out there and make sure there's not something else I should be considering.

You contacted the police and let them handle the situation. However, there is more that you can do for the safety of the residents of the group home.\n\nDefinitely contact the group home and ask to speak to someone in charge.

If the group home is run by an organization, then also CC the org. in any emails you send. \n\nIt is definitely within your realm to ask what the group home will do in the future to ensure the safety of the neighbourhood, considering that one of their residents invaded your home. Considering that many people in group homes may have behavioural issues, you're lucky that this did not escalate, but should emphasize that to the group home as well.\n\nContacting state watchdogs might also be a good route. A google search for Michigan states that group homes don't require a license unless giving a specific level of care (which sounds like this one would probably need one).

I'll keep this as short as possible and will answer questions if necessary. I also don't post to reddit normally, so I'm sorry if this isn't right or is formatted weirdly.\n\nI was referred to a dental surgeon by my dentist who I very recently began going to. The referral was originally for one tooth that needed to be removed and would eventually become an implant. X-rays were taken and sent to the surgeon. I called both offices to confirm. I went to a consultation, during which I explained to the surgeon that I woke up during other oral surgeries and that I do not react well to anesthesia. More X-rays were taken by the implant surgeon. While waiting for the removal appointment, I had a filling come out on the other side of my mouth and it ended up needing to also be an implant. Again, X-rays and updates were sent to the surgeon on March 1.\n\nThe day before my procedure, I was given a prescription for something to \"relax\" me. I was sent a consent form with teeth #30 and #19 to be removed in order to take this prescription. I signed the consent and scanned it back to the office. I took the pill as prescribed and it did not have any effect on me that I could tell. I let them know I felt nothing when I arrived for the procedure. I felt rushed through the paperwork when I went inside and was told \"we need to hurry we are behind\" (it was 7:45 AM). I paid what I owed in cash, for both teeth. I was given nitrous through a mask and felt nothing. I began to cry (because I wasn't feeling safe) and try to speak to the nurse, but she continued to hook me up to monitors and talk to people outside of the room.  I told them they would not be able to find a vein in my right arm, but they attempted anyway. The dental surgeon came in and found a vein in my left arm and started the anesthesia. Before I fell asleep, I heard the surgeon ask which two teeth to pull.\n\nWhen I woke up, they had pulled one tooth. I immediately asked what happened and they responded that they could not keep me asleep long enough to pull the second. I refused to leave without seeing the surgeon, but they called in my boyfriend (he had driven me) and I was walked to the car. When I was at home with my prescriptions, my boyfriend informed me that they had walked out to his truck and said: \"she is finally asleep, do you know what teeth we are supposed to pull\"? I was livid. I slept through the weekend and called them on Monday. At no point in the conversation did they tell me they had to ask him what teeth. They DID tell me that I TOLD THEM the wrong teeth numbers so they didn't know which ones. I asked if they had my records and my X-rays and they confirmed. I asked why they didn't consult the records and they said \"you signed the consent for the wrong tooth\". I hung up and contacted my dentist. She confirmed that my records were sent on March 1 again and seemed upset. Later, she called me back stating that I should trust the surgeon and schedule another appointment to have the other tooth removed. I called the surgeon and did just that. They informed me that I would have to pay again. I argued this. They stated I would need to pay for anesthesia, and because they couldn't keep me asleep, I would need to intubated, which would be more expensive. I stated that I already paid them in cash to remove two teeth. I asked them \"did you not remove the second tooth because you didn't know which one or because you couldn't keep me asleep\"? They refused to answer this question and transferred me to fiscal. They informed me that they \"knocked $200\" off the price and will be charging me $150 for the second procedure. They also informed me that they called after the procedure to check on me and spoke to my boyfriend because I was sleeping. This never happened.\n\nNote that this is not strictly about money. I am at a loss of what to do now. Do I have a case? Why didn't they check my records? Why did they not consult with me before they put me to sleep? Why did they not look at the X-rays that THEY took? Am I basically losing here because I signed a consent for the wrong tooth? I didn't even know teeth were numbered until this point. I am afraid to go back to them.

They could have done a better job explaining why they had to stop the surgery. \nAs for what you can do you can contact a medical malpractice attorney however your damages are very limited.

Confirmations come directly from the airline and they issue the serial code for the confirmation, Expedia only sends this information along to the person who bought the ticket.   The first thing to determine is that there wasn't a breakdown in confirmation from the airline itself and that the confirmation number she was issued by the airline is valid.   It's rare but the airline can sometimes issue an invalid confirmation serial, which is an error on the airline's part and not Expedia.\n\nThird, you are much better off attempting to fix this through the carrier directly.  It's their seat in their plane and their issued ticket.  Expedia customer service will be an intermediary in trying to make a change to a ticket or correct a problem but if the problem didn't result from Expedia's handling, they're also relying on the carrier to agree to a fix.  This is usually successful, but sometimes it's not.  \n\nIt's much better to work through the carrier 99% of the time.

The results came back negative a day later, but 14 days later, when he was healthy &amp; about to be released, CPS issued a detention warrant, claiming child abuse due to drugs. I haven't seen my son since April 2nd. COVID has probably not helped, but this makes no sense to me, I did nothing wrong. Should I appeal? Should I file something? Do I have a civil suit? I just want my son back\\]\n\nMy son was born on Mar 15, he had ingested meconium and was transferred to NICU. The hospital ran a drug test on both me &amp; the meconium. The presumptive test was positive apparently, the very next day the lab test came back negative. I didn't know this until later, all I care about is staying by my son's side.\n\nIn this small window, a nurse called CPS according to the report. My son's medical records were updated to \"neonatal abstinence syndrome\" at this time. Again, unknown to me at the time, also incorrect. A CPS worker arrived the next day, and opened an investigation based on the nurse's statements. When my son had made a full recovery and was about to be released, they issued a detention warrant on Mar 29th, at which point they acquired his full medical records with the **negative** tests. I had volunteered to drug test many times during this period, all **negative**.\n\nAt the hearing on April 2nd, the report stated my son \"tested positive for cocaine\" \\[not presumptive\\] and was suffering from cocaine withdrawal, and that is child abuse. The real hospital records say he wasn't even scored for withdrawal because tests were negative. I volunteered for a hair follicle test and told the judge I never used cocaine. He read some medical report that still made these claims (that was subsequently lost), and said \"I'm inclined to believe the doctors over you. Mother is in denial. Your son is detained. I authorize, at CPS's discretion, custody to be returned pending a clean hair follicle test and enrollment in substance abuse classes.\"\n\nBy the time I get back to the hospital, my son is gone. I can't begin to explain the horror.\n\nI find out my CPS worker (who had made countless errors in her report), is no longer assigned to my case. They initially tell me her note taking was poor, then quickly change their story to \"this is routine, we always change the case worker\".\n\nDesperate to just have this over, I enrolled in the substance abuse classes, I passed the hair follicle test, I did everything they asked. CPS were silent. I finally obtained his medical records in April, because COVID closed the records department, CPS wouldn't give me their copy, and when I confronted CPS, everyone stopped talking to me. I probably made the situation worse by stupidly threatening to sue them.\n\nMar 4th \"Jurisdictional\" comes around. I get a text from my lawyer saying it's been continued ex-parte. I ask for the report, it STILL mentions the positive cocaine test, and NOW it says return is unsafe because my other son Noah suffered broken bones at my home. I don't have another son! I told them this, nobody wanted to talk to me, supervisors I hadn't previously spoken to were initially helpful, then went quiet.\n\nI start calling around because my attorney is doing nothing. I don't have $8000+ for the lawyers I call who seem interested in the case :( Not even with a loan, because I was laid off due to COVID.\n\nFinally, last Friday, I went to court with all the proof, and my attorney says \"I've got them to remove the cocaine test, but now they have other concerns, about your mental health, and a few other things, you'd have to call them. Now the 6mo clocks starts to get him back - they want him adopted\". I'm starting to have mental health issues because of this nightmare, who wouldn't?!\n\n2 hours later the judge is ready. My lawyer speaks for me, asking to contest (after I insisted), saying nothing else. The judge says \"based on the \\[egregiously err'd\\] report I still find your son should be withheld\". I raise my hand, the judge asks my lawyer what I want, she says \"mom is denying the allegations\". He says \"Of course, all parents deny all allegations, trial is set for July 29th\". My lawyer tells me I've made things complicated.\n\nI thought this nightmare would end on Friday &amp; I'm still in utter shock it didn't.

There may be an allegation against a parent with the same name, in which case you need to show via doctor's records (not having another pregnancy) and other records that it's not you.\n\nI would also talk to your attorney about whether you should appeal to a state elected representative. In essence, this may be a policy problem, in which case they absolutely can put pressure. However, you should never ever make that play without talking to your lawyer, as you can also talk yourself into more trouble by accident.\n\nAlso, if the caseworker and supervisors are stonewalling, you should also talk to your attorney about going through the [DCFAS Ombudsman](https://dcfas.saccounty.net/CPS/Pages/Ombudsman.aspx).", "score": 6}, {"id": "fvo61f2", "body": "At this point, it\u2019s still relatively early in the process (taking the pandemic into account.) If CA is anything like my state, these cases start with a petition from CPS. The judge is legally required to assume everything in the petition is true. The only consideration in the first couple weeks is whether the allegations in the petition create a presumption that the child would be unsafe in OP\u2019s care. Meanwhile, everyone is watching OP\u2019s behaviors. Is she cooperating? Does she appear willing to work with the social workers while the case is pending? Even assuming the allegations are completely false, contacting the social worker repeatedly, asking to speak to supervisors, and behavior that appears out of control is going to make CPS think, \u201cyep, we did the right thing; this woman is out of control and dangerous, mentally unstable, in no position to be caring for an infant.\u201d Again, this is all based solely on the initial petition based on a presumptive positive test. It shouldn\u2019t have happened like this, but we can\u2019t reverse time. OP has to take her evidence and move forward to present her best case at the trial with her attorney\u2019s help.\n\nOP, I get it. I would be extremely frustrated and angry in your situation. The best thing you can do right now is calm down. The trial hasn\u2019t happened yet, so there\u2019s nothing to appeal. It sounds like that is scheduled to take place next month. I know every minute probably feels like a year separated from your baby. Start doing work to help your attorney. Get copies of all of the medical records. Organize them. Make a timeline and reference each document that corroborates your version of events. Write your own timeline of events in chronological order. \n\nDon\u2019t take this documentation and run screaming to CPS or your social worker\u2019s supervisors. They can\u2019t do anything with it at this point. Just share it with your attorney. Your attorney is probably swamped. Many of these types of cases settle before trial with the parent agreeing that they need assistance from CPS to safely care for their children and make a plan. That\u2019s because many cases really do involve parents with substance abuse problems. That\u2019s what the social workers (and probably your attorney) are used to seeing. And that may be why your attorney hasn\u2019t had much time for you yet. As you get closer to the trial, he/she will likely set aside time to meet with you to prepare for trial. \n\nHonestly, the best thing you can do for now is stay in contact with the social worker and remain focused on the end game. CALMLY ask what you can do to get more frequent time with your baby. Bonding time is extremely important for newborns development. Follow their instructions exactly. Don\u2019t argue that there\u2019s no reason for you to jump through each particular hoop. Just do it. The time to argue (but calmly and with your attorney\u2019s help) is on the day of trial.

But you NEED to do this asap, because you are married now.\n\n2.) USICS is also simple. If you filed an application, it is probably abandoned by now (requires meeting in the past two years in person. Your timeline says that is not so). Simply contact USICS, you can set up an online account  [https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do)  You will need a case #. Get that by calling them and doing whatever process they require. You can then write a letter to USICS withdrawing your petition for the visa (most likely a K3 visa). You did not provide the RFE (Request for evidence) when you threw away the tax documents. The processing stopped at that point, and the case was abandoned. If he did come here - it was fraud on his part - and this is of little concern for you. You can probably get a free consult with an immigration attorney, they would also probably write the letter withdrawing the petition (which USICS has by now abandoned unless there was a fraud and he actually came here, which is highly unlikely) for $150.\n\nThe reason I say he never came here unless there was fraud on his part, is that the process requires your participation (and financial ability to support him). USICS never got the documentation, they probably never scheduled him an interview, and even if they did, he would not have the evidence to prove a bona fide marriage without you active participation in the process (pictures, financial docs, letters, other required proof). It is possible that some other family members provided him with these docs, and he did come here, but again that is really not your problem, and also highly unlikely. The process would work in a way that two years after coming here he would have to go to another interview in the USA (with you) and prove the continued marriage. Again, this could only be accomplished in this case with fraud, and great difficulty on his part - so again, the most likely outcome is the petition was abandoned when you did not reply in the first place.

During the actual wedding ceremony you would be asked a series of questions, and one of those is whether you are entering the marriage upon your free will. If you had visited the governing body, and have been read all of the legal questions, signed a document, you are legally married. If you have been to a religious ceremony, you are not legally married. \n\n\nSo according to the Macedonian Family law, you can ask to anul the marriage because you have been forced into it, but in my opinion, in your case it will be difficult to prove that. Also according to the law the marriage is considered to have ceased to exist if the spouses haven't lived together for 1 year. This means that theoretically you are not married any more, but you would still have to have the court's ruling, or court's decision in order to prove that the marrige is over, otherwise your husband may still seek all legal rights that he is entitled to upon marrige. On those grounds, and the fact that you don't have kids, your marriage can be very easily divorced.

Every jurisdiction is different, but here's some general advice. Everyone has give great advice about the recording and I even saw one person mention you can call 911 to check that the officer is legit... but definitely still pull over. Your best option really is to pull over (you have no reason to suspect he's lying about being an officer) and just demand the road supervisor. You may have to wait. If he doesn't call the road supervisor, call 911 and ask them to send the road supervisor. Tell them you are concerned about the officers previous inappropriate actions and want a witness. \n\nAlso, dispatch records are public information. You should be able to request records via the freedom of information act. Someone at dispatch or in your local government should be able to walk you through this process. Call your non-emergency line to ask. Go ahead and write down all the dates/times you remember being pulled over and keep a log from here on out. Most departments are going to require officers to call out their stop and the tag on the vehicle (and he may be subject to disciplinary action just for failing to do so, so if you can prove he's failing to call out his stops that might be enough to at least get him reprimanded). This guys sounds like he may be the kind of asshole to try to keep things off the record but there may still be some records to pull.\n\nAlso, and this is not to scare you but to inform you - when officers run your tag they get all kinds of personal information. I cant speak for your state, but most places list the address and driver the vehicle is registered to. If he's ever taken your license he would be able to run that (even in the future if he's got the number) and see where you live, possibly your previous addresses, some places even list socials. In my state the registered owner is run with the tag, so even if hes never taken your license he may still have seen your details.The amount of info is nuts, but it's also a big deal if he misuses it (state and federal laws apply and yes, they are taken seriously by the bodies that govern themselves databases).

This has been an ongoing matter for about a year now. Initially, we got a red card in the mail saying \u201cdangerous dog, mail withheld\u201d on a dog that had been at our residence for 10+ years. For whatever reason, the carriers decided the dog was too vicious and asked us to move our mail box away from the door (2 inch thick wooden door WITH a security screen, just as the postal service mandates) even though there was no way of him getting out. So, we complied and moved it to the fence along side our driveway, about 5 feet from the public sidewalk. All is well and we continue to get mail. Then, about 4-5 months later, our dog dies (old age, RIP). We kept our mailbox in the same spot UNTIL we noticed mail and packages going missing. Presumably they were stolen because of how easily accessible the mailbox was at this location. So we moved the mail box back to its original spot that it had been in since this house was built in like the 1940s. Again, all is well until about a month later, we receive ANOTHER \u201cdangerous dog\u201d notice in our mail box with no mail. We go to the post office to speak to the post master and ask \u201cwhat dog are you referring to?\u201d and we couldn\u2019t get an answer. They just keep saying \u201cmove your mailbox\u201d. We tell them ma is being stolen but they don\u2019t care. Now the post master is being deliberately rude. We\u2019ve spoken to multiple people including the post master and consumer affairs and they keep saying \u201cwe\u2019ll have to come to a decision\u201d. The dog is literally in ashes. There is no viable reason to withhold mail on a dog hold for a dog that doesn\u2019t exist. So now, we have to go to the post office multiple times a week to pick up our mail, during a pandemic I might add. Sometimes they can\u2019t even find it and we have to come back another day. But here\u2019s the part that really set me off. This morning I go in and pick up a weeks worth of mail and I\u2019m going through the stack and I find a bright yellow card that has our address on it, in bold letters on the bottom it says \u201cdo not deliver this card\u201d so it\u2019s obvious this is for the use of the post office only. On the back of the card, written in marker in all caps its says, \u201cDOG HOLD FOREVER LOL\u201d. It actually says \u201clol\u201d at the bottom. Someone very obviously made a mistake by letting this get lost in my stack of mail. This proves to me that this isn\u2019t a legitimate issue and they are just being petty for the hell of it. What can I do here? I refuse to move my mail box and let my mail continue to be stolen. What is my next step to get this resolved?\n\nTLDR: Mail withheld for dangerous dog.

The pdf has footnotes to the statutes and regs in question. \n\nThe Social Security Act provides that an overpaid person, his/her representative payee, and any\nother person receiving benefits on the same Social Security record as the overpaid person are\nliable for repaying an overpayment. 16 Although SSA issues minor children\u2019s benefits to a\nrepresentative payee, SSA explained that the person it overpaid and their representative payee, if\napplicable, are both primarily responsible for repayment. However, if recovery from the\noverpaid person or representative payee is not possible, SSA\u2019s priority of adjustment 17 includes\nwithholding all or part of the benefit payable to another individual on the same benefit record\u2014\nreferred to as contingent liability. 18\nOur population of overpayment events contained instances in which SSA applied its contingent\nliability policy. 19 In one event, SSA paid survivors benefits to three childhood beneficiaries\nunder a deceased numberholder\u2019s benefit record but later determined one of the three children\nwas no longer entitled to benefits and had been overpaid $34,008. SSA notified the childhood\nbeneficiary\u2019s representative payee of the termination and that it would collect the overpayment\nfrom benefits payable to the other two childhood beneficiaries on the same benefit record. SSA\nfully recovered the overpayment amount from the contingently liable childhood beneficiaries.\nSSA POMS states that, in certain situations, SSA will not presume the overpaid childhood\nbeneficiary is equally liable for repaying an overpayment. 20 POMS also states that SSA will not\npresume equal liability if the available facts when SSA discovers the overpayment negate such a\npresumption. 21 For example, a childhood beneficiary is not liable when a representative payee\nmisuses benefits, receives benefits after the beneficiary\u2019s death, or is overpaid because the\n16 Social Security Act \u00a7 204, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7404.502; and SSA, POMS, GN 02205.001 A\n(December 20, 2012).\n17 See Appendix B for a summary of SSA\u2019s priority of adjustments to recover an overpayment.\n18 Contingently liable individuals are only liable for an overpayment if SSA cannot recover from the primarily liable\nperson(s). SSA will cease its recovery efforts from a contingently liable individual when the benefits are suspended\nor terminated, the overpaid person reestablishes eligibility, or SSA grants a waiver of recovery. SSA, POMS,\nGN 02205.005 A (December 20, 2012) and GN 02210.007 A (October 19, 2010).\n19 For our population, SSA\u2019s records showed 1,869 of the overpayment events had a contingent liability action.\n20 SSA, POMS, GN 02205.007 D (December 20, 2012).\n21Id.\nRecovering Title II Overpayments Made to Childhood Beneficiaries (A-04-16-50110) 4\n \nentitled child is no longer in his/her care.

Given you spelling of trade marks as a single word I assume you are from the US, where the patent attorney profession is very different to everywhere else on the world. A general IP solicitor will be useful, perhaps, in writing a letter to the infringer.  In normal practice, this would happen under instruction from the patent attorney as in my experience, general IP solicitors have fuck all useful knowledge on registered IP rights - only registered patent and trade marks attorneys should do this as unjustified threats based on a passing understand of rights aids no one.   A solicitor with copyright experience should be sought for that unregistered right should be sought, though any patent attorney with a designs practice will have an understanding of the overlap and provide advice at first instance, and will likely practice alongside a copyright solicitor in any case.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fwv26pi", "body": "There's your answer, OP.

We emailed her back in May to share that we were expecting and this was her response:\n\n\"Congratulations... \u00a0I\u2019ve mentioned to my business partner that you are expecting a baby in June and I am to be blamed for not realizing a baby\u2019s on it\u2019s way when you\u2019ve moved in.... \n\nSaid and done, we are not sure how the upper unit would handle the sounds of baby crying and extra foot traffic, as the wall has poor sound proof. \u00a0Not to discourage you from having many more children in the future, but an advance notice, our Rental application &amp; Lease Agreements are for two person- maximum. \u00a0 And we had wanted to keep it that way. \u00a0So, down the line, please consider another place to rent if you do decide to raise 2nd child and more in our building, even though you are wonderful tenant. \u00a0We need to keep everyone happy in our building.\"\n\nWe completely ignored the email which was obviously out of line, harassing, and discriminating in our opinion. We are not confrontational so we decided to let it go and not even acknowledge it. We understand our rights under the Fair Housing Act and the city's tenancy law which does not consider children under the age of 6 as occupants, so she is really just trying to pressure us with no real basis.\n\nShe just got back a couple of days ago and started being extremely rude, barely saying hi and hinting at the fact that our common area smelled like garbage because of us. Nothing too substantial yet but we're talking about a very entitled person who has been passive aggressive ever since we moved in. In addition, our main bathroom has a major plumbing issue which causes the tub and toilet to clog every couple of months. She has acknowledged the issue is from the poor piping, as repeatedly pointed out by the plumber. She has done nothing to fix this issue even though she promised to handle the situation months ago. Every time it happens she expects us to contact the plumber, negotiate the price, pay him, and deduct the amount from our monthly rent, which should not be our responsibility.\n\nWe appreciate any advice on whether to take legal action if she were to continue to pressure us to move out or harass us.

I used my turn signal to indicate I would be pulling to the side of the road and left it on for 30 seconds before and kept it on until I was at a complete stop. I was stopped for less than 10 seconds when I was rear ended but the other driver. There was space for at least 4 cars in this area with no cars on either side. The damage to my vehicle clearly indicates I was at a stop when she hit me due to the sheer amount of damage her small car was able to do to my Subaru (it\u2019s a sturdy lady). She actually lived two houses down from where the accident occurred. \n\nI did not call the police initially because it seemed obvious that she was at fault (I\u2019m an idiot, I know). But she ended up telling her insurance that I was not leaving the roadway, rather ENTERING it. Which does not make sense with where the damage is on my car nor where the debris on the street is. I am now in physical pain on a daily basis due to this (I\u2019m 27, I feel like I\u2019m 80 now with how stiff my neck/back is atm). \n\nHer insurance (USAA) took about two weeks to even contact us with a decision after giving us a date we would receive a response by and ignoring our calls for 4 days. We ended up having to reach out to USAA on Twitter to even get a response and filing an executive complaint. We finally received a response not 24 hours later stating that I was at fault because it is my job to check traffic before entering the roadway. We contested this and had them review it again only to receive the same decision. \n\n USAA refused to answer any questions on our end when given the decision. They also stated they were going purely off their client\u2019s verbal statement as they did not send them any pictures (I have her husband IN one of my pictures taking a picture of her car).\n\nMy insurance(State Farm) upon hearing their decision immediately turned it over to their legal dept. as they saw the decision as being flawed as well. It was also mentioned that we might be able to take the other driver to small claims court. The lady that rear ended me works for the state and imo anyone willing to lie like that should not be working with sensitive information.\n\nMy question is, if I take this to small claims, who would I need to contact to get this started and would the outcome do anything for me? I was without a car for 25 days and as I said am now in constant pain with a fear of other cars (I know it\u2019s silly, but on residential streets when cars come up behind me I get EXTREMELY nervous and am afraid to get out of their way lest someone hit me again then lie about it). \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.

The estate covered all of her living expenses. A friend lived with her for about a year, and I believe that she was pocketing her friend's rent. \n* She pocketed a lot of cash, including the money people gave us at the funeral (intended to help us pay for the funeral) and my father's savings. \n* She sold the house at a huge loss when she decided that she no longer wanted to deal with the house or the estate. \n* She took $70K for herself, and tried to give me and my brother $400 each. The will stated for the estate to be split evenly 3 ways between me, my sister and my brother.\n* My brother and I asked her for a full accounting, and she refused to comply. She distributed all the money before obtaining our approval. Now there's no money left in the estate account.\n* During all this, the probate attorney sat around with his thumb up his ass. I called his office to explain the situation and request a full accounting, and left a message with his secretary. He never called me back.\n* I hired a lawyer to sort out the situation. My lawyer spent 2 years trying to get a full accounting from the probate attorney. The probate attorney refused to cooperate with us. \n\nSo now I just found out that the probate attorney is in the process of closing the estate. He did not even notify my lawyer. He's helping my sister get away with everything. My lawyer explicitly told him that my sister breached her fiduciary duties in so many different ways, she took more money than she was entitled to, and she was liable for rent. The probate attorney didn't even listen to my lawyer. He sent my lawyer an email a month ago and said something like \"I don't see any issues with how \\[my sister\\] handled the estate, and there's no money left anyway.\" and then yesterday we found out that the court approved the final accounting and they're about to close the estate. There's one final hearing left before they officially close it. My lawyer said that he'll move to reopen the estate and try to settle with my sister in front of the judge. \n\nI know that I have a lawyer, but I'd like a second opinion. I'm afraid that my lawyer isn't doing what he's supposed to do and the estate will close without allowing me to present my case to the judge and fight for what I'm entitled to.

[MA]", "body": "I\u2019m not sure what I should do about the situation, or if this sub is the right one to post on, but let\u2019s see. I could use some direction. I\u2019ve revised the story a bit and withheld names and other identifying info. \n\nThe incident occurred at the beginning of June. After having a conversation with my boss in the late afternoon after the incident, we both decided that the assault should be reported to HR, and so I filed the complaint the next morning. \n\nThe assault took place in an office shared by 8 employees. Keep in mind, I am the only woman in a department of 200 men, and I only add this because he would have never touched any other employee. Generally, I have not had a problem with any man at our worksite and I don\u2019t ever feel unwelcome. I am happy at work, and make it a point to make the most of every day - I value my coworkers and treat everyone as I would like to be treated. So imagine my shock when this employee sicks a blow to the back of my head. \n\nThe employee is \u201cuntouchable\u201d, as in, he\u2019s the best man we have on the floor (almost a supervisor) and he\u2019s gotten away with many things in the past. He looks down upon others but will chat you up like you\u2019re important to him. He likes to sound smarter than he really is. He mingles with upper management so he is well liked and well-received by them. He is my superior. This is important to note. \n\nUnprovoked and out of the blue, he comes into the office and, seeing that I was reading a book on my lunch break, smacks me in the back of the head, causing my glasses to fall from my face and onto my desk. It was a hard blow to the head, and throbbed some time later. Absolutely irate, I turned to face the offending employee with tears in my eyes as four of my office coworkers erupted in laughter at my expense. I didn\u2019t think what the employee had done was funny in the slightest. I couldn\u2019t believe he had done such a stupid thing, someone with his level of seniority and intelligence. \n\nI was shocked and angry. Through tears, I made it clear that I didn\u2019t find the situation funny. The employee that hit me laughed at my response, as if the ordeal had been in good fun, and said \u201cit was just a joke\u201d. Keep in mind, we are all approaching our thirties and he is in his forties... really? He offered a pitiful apology and left the office while I sat there, astonished. I faced the laughing\u00a0coworkers\u00a0and said, \"I am glad that you all found that funny,\" to which they ignored me and went right back to working. \n\nAfter the incident, I was very visibly troubled and upset. I feel completely\u00a0disrespected and unhappy, so much so that I was unable to sleep at night and have cried in the arms of my significant other. I have had to visit a therapist to process what has happened as I have an anxiety disorder and this has thrown me into a state of perpetual panic. I think, above all else, I\u2019m taken aback by the lack of sympathy - upon seeing how upset I was, the employee did not take my concern seriously. I was hit, and hard - with enough force to smack the glasses off of my face. \n\nPlease bear in mind that this is not the first time this employee has hurt me \u201cin good fun\u201d.  We\u2019ve had issues in the past with him flicking the back of my head as I\u2019m working at my desk or clapping extremely loud near my ears to startle me, as a joke I presume. These \u201cjokes\u201d eventually stopped when I asked him to back off. Because he stopped, I didn\u2019t report the incidents to HR and figured we could just move past them like adults. He\u2019s also, as I\u2019ve mentioned, really well liked by the managers, so I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat employee\u201d that makes HR complaints. \n\nAfter an initial call with an HR rep from corporate, I haven\u2019t heard a word in many weeks. Nothing. They said they were going to investigate and asked me what the outcome should be, and I said I wanted the employee terminated. Each meeting the HR rep schedules with me, she cancels and plans again for a later date. She\u2019s done this 5 times now... citing that she is busy and can\u2019t speak to me sooner. \n\nI sent an email to the HR manager saying that I wanted to reach out and discuss my concerns involving the incident and that I am concerned about HR\u2019s lack of communication with me regarding such a sensitive matter. I said that I have messages that haven\u2019t been responded to and I am deeply unsatisfied. I mentioned that I had to leave the workplace due to a panic attack on (date) and spent the remaining day in a state of paralyzing anxiety. As politely as I could, I explained that employees of the past have been terminated over lesser infractions, so I do not think it\u2019s wrong that I feel unhappy about my company\u2019s inaction. Towards the end of the email, I said that I only want to feel safe at work, and I believe - given the severity of the situation - that the employee should be terminated for violating workplace policies and harming me. Of course, I said everything as professionally as I could whilst holding back emotion. \n\nBut alas, I\u2019ve heard nothing back in days now. \n\nWhat can I do to close this situation, if anything? I\u2019d like to speed up the process but at this point, I wish I had filed a police report. Maybe then they would take this seriously. I worry they will find a reason to release me from employment because I filed a report against the company\u2019s \u201cGolden boy\u201d, and I\u2019m feeling a bit defeated. They may fire me \u201cfor performance\u201d or something of the sort... a gut feeling. \n\nThank you guys.", "score": 83, "comments": [{"id": "fynjopq", "body": "Your employer owes you a safe workspace. \n\nYour employer does *not* owe you any specific outcome with this employee.

They aren't invalidated for that sole reason. But it may be used to show some of the things I outlined earlier.
