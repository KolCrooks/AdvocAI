I'm trying to include as much helpful and relevant detail as possible to see where I stand with all of this. Also using a throwaway account just in case. For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.\n\nI've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our \"HR\" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.\n\nDecember came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.\n\nThe company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss/ceo/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.\n\nUnrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.\n\nI have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.\n\nMy review was with our CEO/owner and our \"HR\" yesterday. He essentially leads the entire meeting, telling me that I was a great find for the company, came at just the right time when I did (called me a \"miracle\"), and then proceeds to say that my role is has not become what he wanted it to be and rather than letting me go back to my old position, they are going to \"phase me out\". This was a confusing way of putting it because they told me that was my last day, not to come in next week, but they would pay me for two more weeks of work in addition to what I'm owed for hours worked in January. He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else. Our HR person chimes in to say that if i want to come in for a lunch to \"honor me\" they can arrange for that. The ceo/owner tells me that I probably have a lot of questions, but he says he doesn't want me to ask any of them now and that I can call/email him later with any questions or concerns that I may have. The whole thing felt very weird to me, but I was also very emotional and visibly upset.\n\nThis whole thing has me shocked and extremely scared. Even if I find another job right away, I will not qualify for FMLA once our baby arrives and it seems most places have a 1 year policy before maternity leave kicks in anyways. At this point I'm trying to figure out what my legal rights are. I'm in Oregon, so I know I'm in an \"at will\" state or whatever it's called.

So about 2.5 months ago you asked for a raise and had a bad run-in with your CEO that ended with a lot of unresolved feelings on your side, so probably safe to say that things were not great regarding how he viewed you as an employee. It is extremely logical that after this event in October he had time to review your position and your fit with the company leading up to your annual evaluation in January. If this position was a new to the company position as of September, it is extremely reasonable to expect that he might be contemplating the efficiency of the position, especially since the person doing it expected more money to do it.\n\nIt sounds like everyone at your previous company had strong feelings towards you as a person and liked you very much, which is great, but if the CEO didn't think you were the right fit anymore, that's his right. It's still his right, if he thinks that you aren't happy in the role, to terminate your relationship with the company. Maybe he was afraid your (perceived) unhappiness would breed morale issues, or that you'd get fed up and quit at a critical time. \n\nWhile it sucks in regards to the timing, it seems all very by the book to me (unless of course, he mentioned your pregnancy as a reason during the meeting on the 2nd, which I assume he didn't do or you would have led with that). I am not a lawyer, so by all means consult one if you so desire, but I hope you see the very uphill battle that you will have to prove the 2 things are beyond any doubt directly related (correlation does not imply causation).\n\nOn a final/side note, HR is a position that does not require formal legal training (beyond basic modules that review the laws). While often a Bachelor's degree in HR is usually preferred, many companies just require a Bachelor's degree in something/anything. Having been in a similar position in the past I would like to propose that it is entirely possible that they knew you'd be losing your job when you told them about your pregnancy.

I live in Louisiana, and I was a retail department manager for the same company for 2 years. In the second year, I never used my vacation time and had accrued almost 30 hours. In June of 2019 I announced that I was going to drop down in my position to pursue my own personal business, but wasn't sure if I was going to drop down to a part time sales associate or a full time team lead. I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended. Well, a couple of months go by and I keep following up with my physical therapist (who I see 2x a week), and they say my policy is still active. So I keep going. I realize I wasn't paid out my vacation time, so I get back in touch with the district manager who starts looking into the issue. Turns out, I was paying for my insurance out of my vacation time for a few months, so it was never paid out in cash. She talks to the benefits department and determines they will pay me out that week. Here's the kicker, the REGIONAL manager says he doesn't feel comfortable paying me out at my $17/hour rate that I worked for 2 years because it was apparently changed in the system by my boss to $12/hour, even though I have never worked at the company for $12/hour. I have a full email conversation of the benefits department saying I needed to be paid out at my old rate, and them saying they \"aren't comfortable\". I said screw it, I don't think thats legal and theres no HR department for the company, but I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. Fast forward to now, I got a call from my psychologist saying the insurance was terminated July 28th, and I owe them $400. I also get a call from my physical therapist for the same reason, saying I owe them $1800. I have proof from my ADP (payroll company) log in, that I had paid for the insurance out of my vacation time through November. But it doesn't matter since it was reported as cancelled in July.\n\nThe major question is, what can I do?

Do you have anything in writing that they gave you permission to take the time unpaid? \nIf it exists, what does your employee handbook say about vacation and health insurance when an employee is quitting full time status? As far as I understand, employers aren\u2019t legally obligated to pay you any PTO when you quit. Some only do it if you give two weeks notice, some only if you have no pending disciplinary issues, etc. It\u2019s at their discretion.\nDid you provide written notice that you intended to resign from your current position on x date? \nI don\u2019t understand what you mean that your health insurance was \u201cpaid through your vacation time.\u201d Did they mean they were deducting your insurance premium from the payout of your vacation time? Again, when insurance ends is generally a matter for the employee handbook and it\u2019s technically your responsibility to know when your coverage actually ends and begins, especially if you aren\u2019t planning on securing new coverage or if you know there will be a gap. Doctors offices and insurance companies generally process billing on a delay. \nIf something happened to your coverage prior to what was described agreed upon in writing or what\u2019s standard as described in the handbook, you may have a leg to stand on. You should also have received information on COBRA, though this can take weeks to come. Even though COBRA is generally much more expensive than your employed premium cost, they will often back date the policy to your date of termination and the premium may be cheaper than being on hook for your current bills. It\u2019s worthwhile to do the math. \nIn summary, take a look at what\u2019s in writing and what isn\u2019t. Consider whether you still want to work under this particular manager and company because while what they did might not have been illegal, it certainly isn\u2019t great practice. \nFinally, get everything in writing when you have an arrangement like this in the future and make sure to be super proactive about figuring out health insurance coverage deadlines. \nIf any Louisiana based attorneys or other employment experts would like to correct any of the above, please do so.", "score": 14}, {"id": "fd4koae", "body": "I believe that if your employer has 20 or more employees then they are required to offer you Cobra coverage.

As I was a minor then, I was taken by CPS and sent to live with my mom and stepdad. During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. \n\nHe took all of his stuff and any thing I didn\u2019t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn\u2019t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)\n\nHis dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he\u2019d stop paying it. That\u2019s fine with me as I have no contact with my dad and have been meaning to cut my name off his stuff but hey, life happens. I decided recently that I\u2019d go through it and get my stuff and just let the storage place auction the rest. Opened it up after not seeing it in years, and there\u2019s two firearms. \n\nThere\u2019s no telling if they\u2019re registered (I\u2019m pretty sure he bought them off Craigslist or something similar) or even legal in any capacity. One is a pistol and another is some kind of automatic rifle. Not sure. Don\u2019t know much about guns. I didn\u2019t touch them or the bullet cartridges with them. My sister was with me and touched them to see if they were real. \n\nI closed it, locked it, and called my stepdad to ask what to do. He told me to tell the people that own the units, my mom says go to police since my dad is technically a felon (he\u2019s still in prison for another decade plus) and my sister (paranoid ex drug addict) says we should just leave them and I need to forget my stuff in there because \u201cthe cops will make it look like we own them illegally\u201d (taking that with a grain of salt)\n\nSo.

There was nothing abnormal found and we thought she was just having a rough pregnancy, we went home excited but nervous because she was still in pain.\n\nThe next evening rolled around and she was still in a lot of pain, it was actually getting worse. We went back to the same ER, explained the situation from the night prior and they conducted the same tests and concluded that she was just pregnant and needed an appointment with her OBGYN ASAP. So again, we left with my partner still in pain. \n\nWe made an appointment with the OBGYN for the next day and my partner went to the appointment. It may be important to add that this doctor is in the same hospital where the emergency room was located. After a quick examination, the OBGYN determined that she suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and was experiencing internal bleeding. She was rushed into surgery within the hour to save her life. \n\nFortunately, she has recovered since the incident however we are still strapped with medical debt from both ER visits, the OBGYN and the surgery. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re opposed to paying for the services but feel as if we are entitled to some reprieve and even compensation , given the two missed diagnosis and the almost fatal fallout from them. \n\nIs there any possibility that we have a case against the hospital or at least legs to stand on to ask for a reprieve from the charges?\n\nWe are located in Richmond, Virginia. \n\nThank you for reading, please let me know if any additional information is needed.", "score": 40, "comments": [{"id": "fd0h9jd", "body": "You would have to demonstrate that the misdiagnosis was unreasonable.

Even if the ER doctor(s) did misdiagnose her, they may not have caused her to have to see an OBGYN and have surgery. That may very well have happened anyway (i.e. had the first ER doctor picked up on the ectopic pregnancy, she still may have incurred those OBGYN/surgery costs). You may be able to prove that had the first doctor caught it, you could have taken medication to end the pregnancy rather than requiring surgery, but this option may not have been available in your case (in other words, she still may have required surgery). In short, you aren't going to get money for health care costs that you would have incurred anyway to treat the ectopic pregnancy. However, if you are able to argue that the first ER doctor was unreasonable in failing to diagnose her condition, you may be able to recover the cost of the second ER visit (because it would have been unnecessary had the first doctor properly identified her condition).

In October, the payroll department alerted me to the fact that they were having difficulty because they couldn't find an account in my name.  It seems that even though I was making these contributions, the state wasn't receiving them.  My account expired.  The state most likely sent a notice to a previous address.  I have had to enroll in new account.  Expired accounts lose all rights and privileges connected to that account - I've lost my tier, my retirement is pushed back, and I would have to purchase 7.5 years of service credits at much higher rates.  I was 1.5 years from being vested, now I'm 9 years.  \n\nMy former employer has been completely unhelpful and incompetent over the past three months as I have tried to get answers from them.  In November, HR told me that the accountant had found the discrepancy and was working with the state to fix it.  After a few more weeks of radio silence, I tried to follow up by CCing a higher up, who CC'd other higher ups, and their replies make it clear they don't understand the situation at all.  Obviously, I will continue to push for answers.  Where did my money go?  Where did THEIR required 3% employer contribution go?  Participation for the teacher pension fund in NJ is NOT optional.   I will try and appeal the expiration of my account with the state.  However, if that cannot be undone, then I feel that the my former employer owes me the money they took from my paychecks, the 3% they were supposed to contribute over 28 months, payment for my service credits, and whatever is fair damages for pushing back my retirement (loss of tier).

My mother informed the travel agent she wanted to spend no more than between $6,000-$10,000 total for the trip. My Mother's friend agreed she didn't want to spend more than $5,000 for her portion. My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent. My mother was told the only expenses she would owe for their stays would be cleaning fees and that she would cover the security deposits. All other costs of the trip were to be equally split between my mother and her friend. \n\nAfter reviewing my Mother's accounts over Christmas, I realized a third-party company, on behalf of a travel agent my mother used, has charged my mother more than $50,000 total between her credit card and checking account beginning from before her trip, right up until the end of December. The travel agent is unable to provide invoices for the majority of the $50,000 charged to this third-party company. I was informed that because my mother\u2019s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother\u2019s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. \n\nThe travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. \n\nThe travel agent gained access to my mother\u2019s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. \n\nThe travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.\n\nThe travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother\u2019s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. \n\nI have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  \n\nMy main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? \n\nApologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. \n\nTL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances.

Please let me know if I should go into more detail:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFilling in the picture:\n\n* Hasn't been able to hold a job for 2 years. Has gotten lots of funding from friends and family.\n* Will not entertain any conversation about her health\n* Has moved a dozen times. SF, Michigan, LA, Pennsylvania, etc.\n* Has gotten mugged 3 times (in one of these she had her car stolen and didn't report it)\n* Is sometimes delusional: \"Last week I saw Donald Trump, Putin, and Morgan Freeman walking in San Francisco\"\n* Punched her landlord (no charges filed)\n* Has repeatedly harassed old coworkers and announced intent to hurt them\n   * Got a restraining order filed against her from old coworker\n   * Emailed: \"I have strong desires for all kinds of violence against myself and personal property of others\"\n   * Told a coworker she wants to \"light them up\"\n* purchased and moved into a total junker 26' sailboat and started trying to live anchored out in the Saucalito Bay\n   * When my mom and other sister tried to show up to talk to her about moving off the boat and getting into an apartment she punched my sister in a Rite Aid (no charges filed... maybe something we can still do here?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I've tried to do in the past:**\n\n* Called the police to report that she punched my sister and relayed her violent messages to coworkers:\n   * Police response: \"This is a minor misdemeanor. For us to act on a psychiatric emergency she needs to say \"I want to kill myself/I want to kill someone\"\n* Called in to have a wellness check done #1 after she threatened coworker\n   * Result: She was able to put up a front of \"im fine\" for police\n* Called in to have a wellness check done #2 after she punched landlord\n   * She was taken to the hospital, was unsupervised, and walked out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most recently, she's in LA and just announced:**\n\n* Her intent to buy and try heroin\n* Her intent to buy a gun\n* Her intent to hurt a coworker who won't return calls: That she would \"Light them up\"\n\n**Right now:**\n\n* I'm ***extremely*** worried about doing heroin. I think she could and would absolutely do it, and I think it would be the start of the next extremely deep descent.\n* I believe she needs to be hospitalized/committed, but:\n   * She's never said outright \"I want to kill myself/I want to kill someone\" (*extremely* unlikely she will say this outright while police are around. She always puts on a face with police.)\n   * Will never accept treatment willingly\n* I am afraid of taking an action that will make her angry and disappear again\n* My faith in the police being helpful is extremely low. It seems like she has to be an inch from death before she can be helped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is much much more context to all this.

Yes, it is legal for the complex to contact their attorney. It is legal for them to contact their senator. It is legal for them to contact Martha's baby sitter. It is legal for them to contact the tooth faire, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. That does not mean there is a legal cause of action. They can even file a complaint and hold a hearing. That does not make their position correct.\n2. There are two types of defamation: Slander - oral communication and Libel: written communication. To prevail the complex will have to show the following: What your friend said and wrote was false. The complex must also prove they were injured by the statement. That is people ridicule, hate, lose esteem for... the complex. They would have to prove that the loss of esteem, etc. is directly caused by the false statements. Many jurisdictions also require the plaintiff to show malice when the statements were made. The plaintiff would have to prove a bad intent on the part of your friend. This is a pretty high standard and is why we dont hear/see many of these kinds of cases. Public figures/celebrities have an even higher bar to meet and I bet you a Krispy Kreme vanilla-filled glazed that the judge will make the complex attain a much higher standard.\n\nThis is not a first amendment issue because the first amendment prohibits the federal government from limiting speech.

We live in Salt Lake City Utah\n\nA few months ago I was eating some frozen lasagna and chomped down on something hard. Looking back it's actually kind of funny, because I was eating while playing a game and was momentarily too distracted to realize what I had bitten down on. I soon figured out it was a tooth. Pretty fucking grossed out, but nothing bad really happened. I assumed this would just end up being a funny and slightly disturbing story to tell.\n\nMy fiance's mother was really concerned when we told her. She convinced us that it was a matter of public safety, and we should report it somehow. So we filed a claim with the grocer's health department and waited to hear back. They gave us a bit of a run around, transfering us from one 'adjuster' to the next. Eventually they requested we send the tooth to them in the mail for analysis. (I had saved it like a serial killer in the fridge -- [warning: tooth](https://imgur.com/a/tSh1DoC)).\n\nSo, some time goes by and their representative emails us back confirming that not only was it a **human tooth**, but somehow a **child's tooth**? Fucking nasty. My favorite food is ruined forever. Around this time, they had transferred us to people on behalf of the lasagna company and washed their hands of the situation I suppose. The lasagna folks announce to us that they have filed an official insurance claim and that we were to wait for the next steps.\n\nI guess at this point we were only hoping for some sort of resolution. How did a kid's tooth get in the lasagna? Was there... *gulp* ... the remains of the rest of the child spread throughout thousands of lasagnas worldwide? Was it some sort of kid sweatshop? My friend's joked that I should sue them or something, but for what? For being grossed out? I had no medical bills or anything. I just wanted to see the results of their investigation, and at the very least get my lasagna purchase reimbursed.\n\nThe last thing we have heard is that they don't know where the tooth came from and that their investigation is essentially over. Their insurance agent offered us $250 dollars and wanted to close the case.\n\nPersonally I was stunned that they offered us money. My fiancee and her mother urged me to not take it. They are worried that the company is just trying to pay us off and sweep the situation under the rug. As far as I know, there will be no recall of products and no further investigation.\n\nI guess my main question is: do we have a moral obligation to keep pushing the claim until this company takes some sort of actionable responsibility for the incident? It feels like there could be something scummy going on here. I know the WHO takes these things pretty seriously, but nothing like this has ever happened so I'm not really sure what my rights or obligations are.\n\nthanks for reading, cheers", "score": 37, "comments": [{"id": "ffv6mxa", "body": "What are you going to push if you don't have damages?", "score": 59}, {"id": "ffv6q2j", "body": "I'm not a lawyer,  just someone who has worked in food manufacturing for a decade.

I reached my cap sometime last month. I had planned to go on vacation this month, but with the whole pandemic going on, that didn't happen.\n\nLast month, the company decided to front-load the remainder of the year's PTO hours company-wide so that people had them in the event they or a family member became sick. Some colleague's PTO balance went from 40 hours to 211, 30 hours to 165, etc. \n\nSince my PTO was at it's cap at the time they distributed the front-load, I was given 0 hours. I was told by HR that I would not be accruing anymore hours for the remainder of the year, and I would not be paid for the cap overage. They mentioned that if this happened again in the 2021 calendar year, the overage would be paid out, but not this year.\n\nI have been with the company for a few years and front-loading is not in the policy, nor has it happened before.

CA does allow caps as you know, and does allow advancing PTO yet to be earned.  In your case they will be depriving you of any PTO you would earn during rest of year by changing practice midstream.  So technically you might not have a case until you are below cap and they fail to pay (accrue/credit) the PTO in future pay periods this year. Once that happens you may have a claim for unpaid wages.\n\nTwo ways I could see them handling this that would be proper.  Pay you for 100 hrs already accrued to make room for the advance to fit cap.  Don\u2019t give you the advance and let you accrue as normal. I suppose they could pay you the advance 100 hrs., but that may open them up to having to pay everyone. \n\nAdvanced PTO doesn\u2019t have to be paid off in CA at termination if it wasn\u2019t earned yet, but employer can\u2019t claw back advanced time from final paycheck if it\u2019s already used.  So if your coworkers use all their advanced PTO and then quit/fired/laid off, they come out ahead. (How\u2019s that to cheer you up?)\n\nI\u2019d try to work it out with employer (in writing). If that hits a wall file a wage complaint with DLSE.  Don\u2019t mention or threaten DLSE to employer, just file if you can\u2019t work it out.  DLSE wants to see you tried to resolve it also, so request a solution, follow up in written form, then escalate as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;How is vacation earned?\n\nA.\n\nIn California, because paid vacation is a form of wages, it is earned as labor is performed. An employer's vacation plan may provide for the earning of vacation benefits on a day-by-day, by the week, by the pay period, or some other period basis. For example, an employer's policy may provide that an employee will earn a proportionate share of his or her annual vacation entitlement for each week of a calendar year in which the employee either works at least one full day or receives at least one full days' pay during such week. Thus, for example, if an employee is entitled to two weeks (10 work days) annual vacation, and works full-time, eight hours per day, 40 hours per week, in the above example for each week the employee works at least one full day, he or she will earn 1.538 hours of paid vacation, calculated as follows:\n\n10 work days entitlement per year x 8 hours/day = 80 hours vacation entitlement per year\n\n80 hours vacation entitlement per year \u00f7 52 weeks per year = 1.538 hours of vacation earned per week\n\nIn contrast to how vacation pay may be earned, the calculation of vacation pay for terminating employees (a quit, discharge, death, end of contract, etc.) who have earned and accrued and unused vacation on the books at the time of termination must be prorated on a daily basis and must be paid at the final rate of pay in effect as of the date of the separation. For example, an employee who is entitled to three weeks of annual vacation (15 work days entitlement per year x 8 hours/day = 120 hours vacation entitlement per year) who quits on August 7, 2002 (the 219th day of the year) without having taken any vacation in 2002, who has no vacation carry-over from prior years, and whose final rate of pay is $13.00 per hour, would be entitled to $936.00 vacation pay upon separation, calculated as follows:\n\nPro rata daily basis:\n\n219 days (August 7, 2002, date of quit) \u00f7 365 days/year = 60%\n\n60% of 120 hours vacation entitlement = 72 hours vacation earned and accrued through August 7, 2002\n\nVacation days used in 2002 = 0\n\nVacation earned but not taken at time of separation = 72 hours\n\n72 hours x $13.00/hour = $936.00 vacation pay due at separation.\n\nhttps://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_Vacation.htm", "score": 2}, {"id": "fnr8vif", "body": "&gt; Don\u2019t mention or threaten DLSE to employer, just file if you can\u2019t work it out.\n\nTerrible advice.

You'd likely fail on an argument that going forward they still have to allow you to accrue PTO. You may have a solid argument the PTO cap is \"unreasonable\" and youre owed X hours. Here is why:\n\nIssue 1: Can the company prohibit you from accruing  PTO for the rest of the year?\n\nIn general, vacation compensation is considered to accrue in increments on a daily basis, and an employer cannot defer the accrual of vacation compensation to the end of a month or the end of a year to avoid the pro rata accrual of vacation benefits. Suastez v. Plastic Dress-Up Co., 183 Cal. Rptr. 846 (Cal. 1982). Subject to these limitations, an employer can generally determine the rate at which employees accrue vacation compensation and whether employees are to accrue any \r\nvacation compensation at all. See, e.g., Owen v. Macy\u2019s, Inc., 96 Cal. Rptr. 3d 70 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009).\n\nIn your case, the company advanced accrual of vacation hours to provide employees with PTO to deal with COVID during our stay at home order period. This is the opposite of a deferral to avoid prorata accrual--which is pretty much the only limitation the law puts on companies when deciding the rate of accrual or whether you can accrue vacation at all. So unfortunately, if they want to cut off accrual of PTO going forward they can.\n\nIssue 2: Do you have a claim for the advanced PTO accural which was lost because you were already capped?\n\nAn employer can enforce a \"reasonable cap\" on the accrual of vacation compensation that would allow an employee to retain all previously earned vacation compensation, but that would not allow the employee to earn any additional vacation compensation until some of the previously earned amount had been used. Boothby v. Atlas Mech., Inc., 8 Cal. Rptr. 2d 600 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992). In defining \"reasonable\" in this context, the Labor Commissioner has taken the position that a worker must have at least nine months after the accrual of the vacation within which to take the vacation before a cap is effective. This \"reasonable\" time allows an employee to take fully vested vacation at times convenient to both the employee and employer without forcing an employer to accrue a large vacation pay (or time) liability. DLSE Guidance. \n\nHere, the question is whether you were provided at least nine months after the accrual of the vacation to take a vacation before the cap was effective. For any vacation time which you did not have nine months to use it before the cap was effective you have a good argument that when the PTO was advanced, those X hours should not be subject to the cap and should be included into your PTO account.\n\nMy daughter is finally asleep so Im signing off to spend time with the wifey.

IG won't review profile. Now she's posting my work information. (USA)", "body": "Alright y'all, this one is a doozy, so I appreciate you all in advance for reading this!\n\nIt's better that I start from the beginning - about 2 years ago, a random girl sent me a friend request on FB. We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. \n\nEverything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest. At that point, she had been posting on it for a week before I found out about it.\n\n It was a fake account, but I instantly knew it was her (typing and word style, emoji usage, similarities between her real account and the fake account, and she admitted in one of the posts that she did the same thing over a year ago). \n\nIt became clear to me that this girl is not stable and I wanted to protect my safety, so I filed a police report for harassment. The police are currently investigating, although the investigator said, \"we probably can't do much because it's on social media and hard to prove it's her\", but I have so many screenshots that link her to the profile, but I'm afraid I won't get very far with the local police with this.\n\nShe does not live in my same city anymore, but she's just a few hours away. This account is seriously causing me some major emotional distress. I have reported it over and over to IG and have had trusted friends report it as well, but because of COVID-19, IG is saying they don't have enough people on staff to review the profile. \n\nBut then, I woke up this morning to the girl now posting my work information on the fake profile. My work email, my work phone number, and saying \"for a good time to call me\" and I can't get IG to do anything about this. I have a really good job and I do not want her compromising it. She is still currently posting as I type. She has over 100 posts about me now, most including my personal information and slanderous comments. \n\nWhat can I do? Is there any way to get ahold of IG, and could they be liable for emotional distress?

I really need advice so if someone could please read my story I would really appreciate it.\n\nI live in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\nI needed to put my items in storage when I was planning on travelling Australia, so I asked my mom and stepdad to help me move out of my apartment and store my items and they offered to help me if I paid them something like $100 for the gas, I agreed (stepdad has a work truck). \nI had packed about half of everything and they came over and helped me pack the rest(along with my friends), I put all of my clothes into garbage bags (about 8-10 bags), we moved all my necessities (including mattress, duvet, duvet cover, desk, bed frame, everything I owned) into the work truck and I told them to just put all my stuff under their house in the basement. \n\nI was originally going to donate some bags of clothes but I didn't have enough time to sort through them so we donated some furniture (my couches) to the salvation army, they wouldn't accept one of them so my stepdad said he would go to the dump and throw it out. I told them I'd deal with everything else when I get back in a year or so (they have a lot of storage space).\n\n\n**Fast forward**: I had to come home early due to covid, so after about 30 hours of travel I arrive back in Canada to my parents house. I went under the house because I wanted to wear a big comfy sweater that I missed (I only brought a suitcase of summer clothes to Australia because I knew it would be much warmer there). I go under the house and can't find any bags of clothing... I ask my mom where she put them and she said \"I'm not sure, whatever isn't there was donated\". WHAT?? They never said they were going to donate anything, as I asked them to keep all the boxes and bags. I asked further and she said that my roommate told them they could be donated, I immediately messaged him and he said that he heard them joking about just donating the items when I left, and he said he chimed in and said that he himself got rid of all of his stuff and joked around with them. I told her that excuse was bullshit and they could have had any ANY type of communication with me and I would told them to NOT get rid of the items... \n\nMy mom then said that some of the boxes were ripped and the bags had holes in them so she got rid of them. I continued to search and couldn't find much of anything. They got rid of my duvet, mattress, both of my memory foams pillows, drawing books with all my drawing supplies, VR headset, Samsung galaxy s8+ (including photos and memories that I did NOT upload), 500$ headphones, Google nexus, iPod, Nintendo 3ds, stereo system, they were ALL GONE along with all my clothes. \n\nThey would not have sold my items (they aren't intelligent enough to figure out prices and sell them). So they just threw out or donated them because they didn't want to deal with them. What they DID keep was reorganized into boxes and they labelled themselves. They kept DVDs, CDs, my Xbox 360, my computer and monitor and a bag with some jackets and shoes and then pots and pans. \n\nI am beyond heartbroken. I had so many sentimental items from travelling and clothing items and if I knew they were going to do this I would have called literally ANYONE else to store my things. \n\nI am talking to them tomorrow since my stepdad comes home (he works in a different city) and I literally don't know what to do. I am in 14 day isolation so I haven't been talking with my mother. I know my stepdad will try and shove it back in my face by saying \"oh you left us with too much shit!\" But they didn't say ONE word to me that they didn't want to deal with it.\n\n I am a grown 25 year old man and they treat me and my belongings like I'm a child. Do I tell them to repay me for all of the items or talk to a lawyer about this? I am so nervous about the talk tomorrow - My step dad is quite manipulative and gets rid of things that clog up space for him, and my mom is a push over and gets stressed at the smallest things and is very emotionally immature so tomorrow is going to be very difficult. \n\nI don't have any intention of talking to my parents ever again after this. I trusted them and they completely betrayed that trust. All it would have taken is a phone call and I could have gotten someone to pick up my stuff or hired a moving company to put it in a storage locker. I feel empty and like I have nothing now. I was super into fashion and had so many expensive designer items, professional workwear and winter clothes that were donated and things collected over the years from travelling/concerts/festivals. \n\n\nCan anyone **please** give me advice on how to deal with this?

I told him I was not given an option for where or how the cabling entered the building (the cabling was there when I moved in) and he should contact the ISP to discuss moving the cables, as multiple tenants connections run into the building at the same spot.

Basically the app takes PSI and puts it in standard government forms. The issue with the forms is that they get updated a lot. At the time I worked out with the family member that I would get paid $50 dollars per case. This never panned out so I worked out that I would get paid hourly ($150/h). I know that rate sounds steep but they can afford it due the high volume of cases that my app enables them to process. In addition, other firms have full time employees that literally just do form programming.\n\nThe issue arrived recently where they stopped paying my invoices to update the forms. Their argument is that it was a \"subscription service\". Yes, I attempted to make it a subscription service, and even got two customers, but the monthly income is not enough to cover my hourly labor. I couldn't even hire a 10/h Indian laborer to make it worth it.\n\nSo yesterday, after releasing the government agency pushed out updates to 7+ of their forms, I realized that I cannot do it anymore because my carpal tunnel syndrome was really kicking off (I have a full time job in addition to this job). I sent an email out stating that I am going to shut down in 60 days and provided an alternative service to they can migrate to. Now they are threatening to sue for all the customization (form programming and this government API interface) I did for them.\n\nWhat type of lawyer will I need to fight this?

If you have good insurance, they should be handling this for you, and you can rest assured that they don't want to pay these (likely) fraudsters either.  I would send the video to your insurance people, but that is all.\n\nIn my case, my insurer began to negotiate with their lawyers and offered WAY less than my policy limits (which the lawyers initially demanded).  The negotiations actually dragged on for a long time, and the claim ended up being transferred to someone in my insurer's fraud department because the doctor the driver&amp;passenger went to is known to be shady, and the damage to their car was so clearly insignificant to cause injury.\n\nLong story short, the fraudsters got tired of not getting anywhere and after about a year they fired their lawyers and settled directly with my insurance company for way less than my policy limits (they got a few thousand dollars each).  Funny part is, the lawyers they fired probably had a lien for any funds they were awarded since they lawyers had already put in the work, so the fraudsters likely got less money and STILL had to pay their lawyers.\n\nSorry for the novel but I am just trying to ease your worries.

Anyone that knows better, please correct me by all means.\n\nI'm now wondering if hand-carried letters of this sort could count as mail in the USA.  (The USPS went through a pretty hair raising phase in their first years - [once upon a time, people could and DID actually mail their children!!!](https://www.history.com/news/mailing-children-post-office))\n\nMore seriously, though...\n\nIf the envelope itself was specifically addressed to her friend and trustee (as in, it had their name written or typed on it), one could say that because it was addressed to the friend and not any of her children, then it could be said that you were respecting the privacy held between herself and her friend/trustee.\n\nAnd that's the pretty much how it is in the US Postal Service.  Their regulations state that they can only open someone's mail by authorization of the addressee, or in compliance with a search warrant, or if the address is unintelligible and opening it is the only way to determine where it's supposed to be delivered.\n\nThen there was the verbal condition that you were not to reveal the letter to the her children.  I'm not certain what the law is in California, but some places do honor verbal agreements as contracts as long as both parties remain in agreement over the terms.\n\nThat said, the addressee did indeed instruct you to open the letter so you could read them it's contents, so you're covered there.  And given the situation, the quick relaying of this information was very much needed.\n\nThis is where you done a good, OP.  A cursory google search tells me that had there been no will known to the appropriate authorities, she would have died \"Intestate\" (without a testament) - which means that the State or Local governments would have decided on how her estate would be divided amongst her family.  And a decision that might look entirely logical to the government would probably have caused... well, only heaven knows, but it likely would not have been pretty.\n\nHere's some second-hand experience from my own family, just so you understand what you may have helped avert - I hope this does make you feel better.\n\nMy mother's maternal grandfather had passed away when I was 1 y.o., and the surviving widow had actually been his second wife.  This woman he had married out of pure practicality as his first wife was terminally ill and he had children whose welfare he needed to assure.  There was absolutely no way he could have managed by himself because he was a firefighter in the city's fire department and spent days at a time living in the firehouse.  (This was circa 1920)\n\nHe left no will behind, thus he died intestate, and the government decided that his entire estate would be handled by his widow.  Which seems logical on the surface, right?  Not if you were familiar with the family dynamics, though.  His widow knew what she was getting into when she married into the family and treated the arrangement as little more than a job.  Thus, after he passed, many precious family heirlooms were lost - many of which had significant sentimental value to my mother and the rest of her family - because the widow and her own family took them all, sold whatever they could, and walked away with the rest.\n\nIt was legal, but you can't really say that it was just.\n\nWhatever the situation for your neighbor was, you can rest assured that at the very least, you done *her* justice in making certain that her last will and testament would be carried out.\n\nPS - Friendly reminder to anyone who has any property or accounts of any significant value: Make absolutely certain that you have a last will made out, and that a trusted friend or family member knows where it is at.

I furiously decided to read the parking bylaws and it mentioned nothing about parking in my driveway.

(A.B. 50,097-55; A-750-1374) (See A-750-1740)\n\n* An agreement made in the course of employment to increase pay, with the amount and date specified, becomes, in the absence of special circumstances, a condition of the employment which, if not fulfilled, justifies voluntary leaving and subsequent refusal to return without such increase.

We want her out of the house ASAP.", "body": "Hi all, this is a bit complex so I'll try to simplify as much as possible.\n\nI live with my boyfriend and his older brother in a home they own together. We're 26-30 years old. About 9 months ago, their family friend Roommate (20M) moved in. We all pay rent, utilities, etc. About 4 months ago, Roommate asked if his girlfriend of two years could move in. Brothers agreed and added $150 to Roommate's rent so that the cost could be split between Roommate and Girlfriend.\n\nProblems begin immediately. Girlfriend is an all around bad roommate. She has no job or savings so Roommate pays the full portion for rent and for food. They both smoke marijuana excessively, but Roommate has a medical marijuana card and works at a smoke shop so we leave it alone. (We don't smoke) Girlfriend never got a key to the house so she just leaves it unlocked while we're all at work. She steals food. She left the backyard after open and let the dog out. Etc.\n\nRoommate and Girlfriend break up because he caught her sending nudes to multiple people. She said it was for money. He said there were no transactions. He makes up excuses about her moving out for a few weeks but she finally leaves.\n\nThis brings us to Sunday. We're eating with a mutual friend and find out that Girlfriend is 16. We're all horrified and angry at roommate for dating a minor and not telling us while she was in the house.\n\nWhen we get home that day, we find her in the house. Alone. No idea how she got in.\n\nSo here come the questions. She's still here because Roommate is refusing to make her leave no matter what the brothers say. How do we get her to leave? Does she have any tenants rights if there is no written lease and she never paid for anything?\n\nRoommate is saying she should be allowed to stay because he already paid her part of the rent. He thinks she should stay for a month or two more. She hides from us.\n\nBrothers are considering calling the police to remove her, but I'm worried they could be held liable for her actions since they happened in the house. Underage drug use, distributing child pornography, and statutory rape come to mind. \n\nRoommate is on probation, but I don't know for what. I don't know how this would affect him.\n\nA friend said calling CPS might help? She didn't have a poor family situation before moving in. She lived with her parents 2 hours away.\n\nOlder brother is considering forcibly taking her to her parents house on Saturday while Roommate is at work. I think that could end poorly.\n\nHow can we resolve this as safely and legally as possible?\nLocation is Mesa, AZ.\n\nEdit: Moved city to the bottom of the post.\n\nUpdate: We threatened to call the police and she left to go to a friend's house until her parents pick her up. As landlords, the brothers told Roommate that girlfriend is not allowed back in the house. As friends, we're trying to get him to cut all contact with her since the relationship is clearly inappropriate. Whether or not he continues living here is up to the brothers. \n\nI appreciate everyone's advice.", "score": 109, "comments": [{"id": "fngd623", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1}, {"id": "fngdcax", "body": "*Your post may have been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\n**Bad or Illegal Advice**\n\nYour post has been removed for offering poor advice.
