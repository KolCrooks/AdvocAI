Her department tests all incoming L&amp;D patients for Covid-19. After we found out that she is pregnant, her doctor provided a note advising that she no longer work with Covid-positive patients, as pregnant women are at higher risk for severe Covid illness. The hospital provided this accommodation for her. The doctor also advised against getting the vaccine while pregnant, since it is not approved for pregnant women and there is no data regarding the vaccine and pregnancy. \n\nWith the current Covid spike, her hospital's Covid-19 floor is losing nurses - some are quitting and many are getting sick. My wife is now being told that she needs to work shifts on the Covid floor despite the following factors:\n\n- She is NOT a med-surg nurse and has no expertise in caring for Covid patients\n- According to the CDC, pregnant women are immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19\n- Her doctor (who works at this hospital) strongly advises her against any exposure to Covid patients; the doctor has also directly communicated this to my wife's supervisor\n- She is one of the very few pregnant nurses, and one of the only nurses that will not receive the vaccine within the next month; this means that almost all other nurses will have essentially no risk of illness while working with Covid-19 patients \n\nI'm aware that being pregnant is not considered a disability under ADA.

He claimed to be on specific pain meds at the beginning of the call for a health issue so I tried to brush it off as a joke while he was under the influence and really didn\u2019t know what to do, but it continued to bother me. The more I thought about it the more I realized he had made multiple worrisome comments regarding other situations with sexual assault in his personal life as well as things that in hindsight seemed mildly threatening. Joke or not and regardless of meds it isn\u2019t okay to say you\u2019re going to rape or sexually assault someone ever, so a few days after I got back to work I reported it hoping we could sit down and discuss that it wasn\u2019t okay at all and to hopefully make me feel more comfortable at work. \n\nI was interrogated with multiple witnesses on a few occasions after making my initial statement, as were a few coworkers that were aware of the situation because I was extremely upset and confided in them. The employer insinuated that it was not okay to discuss this with anyone but my boss during their questioning of me, as well as asking me if the aggressor seemed like the type of person would really assault me. In addition, many of their questions were extremely specific about who I had spoken to at what time and when and where I was throughout the days since, which I admitted to them my answers were not as specific and almost certainly missed details because I was extremely upset and growing more overwhelmed the longer this went on.\n\n Ultimately the mediation I had requested so that I could have some semblance of peace of mind or an apology because I was hoping he would do the right thing and admit it was a terrible mistake did not happen. Instead nothing was discussed and we were told not to interact in any way at work. We were also both given a few restrictions on where we were allowed to go at work and our interactions with others were both limited.\n\n Quite frankly the interactions they were limiting more seriously affected my day to day interactions with colleagues than his, because the place I am no longer allowed to go to discuss work projects he rarely sat at or sought information from. They said nothing in that moment about sexual assault not being tolerated or that he shouldn\u2019t bother me outside of work, just that there is to be no contact while in the building. \n\nIt feels like they\u2019re covering for him while isolating me and I\u2019m really worried about the security of my job for having sought help in this matter. I just want to feel safe and comfortable at work and this ordeal has been really bad for my mental health. In addition, I\u2019m now worried that they made it seem like I somehow did something wrong in the handling of this?\n\n I love my job and am not trying to harm my employer in any way as it\u2019s a family business and the family is truly wonderful, but I\u2019m feeling really hurt by what has happened and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m also worried because my boss made a lot of statements to impress upon me that he didn\u2019t seem to believe the guy would hurt me but what if he does? He clearly didn\u2019t think about how hurtful it would be to say he would rape me so how am I to trust that it wouldn\u2019t get worse even if he can\u2019t contact me at work when the original incident happened when I wasn\u2019t at work to begin with.

Also, the entire place smelled and felt like a construction site, like it had been swept up but none of the floors or surfaces had been properly washed. The builder says they were storing all their tools and equipment in our unit during renovations of the other units, which I suspect is why it seemed so dusty.    \n\n\nSo obviously, the landlord has violated the terms of the lease and failed multiple times to live up to their promises. For us this is a red flag that we should have seen a long time ago, and we want out.  We want to terminate the lease and get all of our money back, but we're not sure if we really have grounds to take them to small claims court and both of us are nervous about getting involved with that on the chance that we can't get our money back and we go further into debt with the cost of legal help.", "score": 277, "comments": [{"id": "g54485k", "body": "Speak to a housing lawyer.

To me it's weird how they have to \"release\" me, when the leasing period already finished.\n\nOn the lease it says that it *\"shall commence until 08/31/2020, at which time thereafter shall become a month to month tenancy upon* ***written approval*** *of the landlord.\"*,\n\nso it clearly says that in order to extend the lease and pay monthly after expiration, you need a written approval of the landlord. I don't know if the remaining roommate applied for an extension of the lease, but if they did it was most certainly without my consent. I have NOT requested nor signed anything regarding prolonging the lease. To me, this sounds pretty illegal?\n\nI have sent my 30 day notice of terminating, both emailed and called the office, but they simply tell me that in order for them to release me, my remaining roommate needs to fill in a release form and prove that they would be able to finance the rent themselves (which they refuse to do). Until then, the company claims that I'm obligated to keep paying rent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've moved to a new place I'm paying rent for, I cannot afford to pay to 2 rents and even if I did, I obviously don't want to. The remaining roommate isn't planning on leaving anytime soon, they're planning to keep chilling where they are, and have me pay part of the rent. Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to break free from this horrific situation? (The landlord couldn't care less and keeps telling me that in order for me to \"go\", **remaining tenant must release me from responsibility and income qualify on their own**)", "score": 37, "comments": [{"id": "g50ljxp", "body": "[removed]", "score": 0}, {"id": "g50lnm0", "body": "**Generally Unhelpful, Simplistic, Anecdotal, or Off-Topic**\n\nYour comment has been removed as it is generally unhelpful, simplistic to the point of useless, anecdotal, or off-topic.

Obviously, since your landlord can't evict, he will be forced to approve the lease extension.  I'm not sure it matters whether you personally requested an extension.  Your roommate did this by his actions.  The legal issue is whether his unilateral actions bind you under the terms of the lease.  Obviously, your landlord is taking the position that his unilateral actions bind you.  Your landlord might be blowing smoke, or he might be very familiar with the law where you live.

I was badly bitten on my neck by a dog we adopted and required about 30 stitches. For the back story, a couple posted the dog on a rehoming page because they said they couldn\u2019t care for him any more. They said he was a good, well behaved dog that was great with older kids and cats. They disclosed that they adopted the dog from an animal rescue, and were under a contract with them, where if they couldn\u2019t care for the dog, they would surrender him back to the rescue. The rescue told them that they did not have room for the dog, and told them to try to rehome him. We responded to the post about the dog and talked to the owner. We also talked to the animal rescue person about him, who said he was a really good dog and they never had any problems with him. The rescue person said we could sign a new adoption contract and adopt him if we wanted. We met the owners, the dog seemed really good, so we signed and brought him home. We had him for a week or so and everything was good. Thursday, my son was sitting on the couch with the dog. I kneeled down to pet the dog when he growled and lunged at my neck and tore it open. My 12 year old son witnessed the whole thing. My wife took me to the ER where they cleaned the bite and stitched it up. We contacted the rescue and told them what happened, and told them we have to surrender the dog. They told us they didn\u2019t have room, and it would be up to us to rehome him again. They then went on to say that he must have done it because he was being protective of my son or because I was provoking him. We called city animal control and surrendered the dog to them. Because of the severity of the bite, they said he would be quarantined for 2 weeks. My wife did some poking around on the rescue\u2019s website and found more information. About this dog. He bit a previous owner\u2019s daughter in the face where she required stitches, which was not disclosed to us by the rescue. I apologize for the lengthy backstory, but wanted to try to get the facts in there. My questions are: What will happen if the rescue tries to sue us for breach of contract for not rehoming the dog?

It is not always for a nefarious purpose.  Sometimes it just has to do with demand and space.  I recently adopted two 12 week old kittens.  They were turned into a shelter in another state at 5 or 6 weeks.  They were cared for a fostered there before being transferred to my state, where I adopted them.  Now, were they being moved around because of anything bad?  No.  I suspect they were moved because our shelter has a LOT of demand and the shelter they were given to has less space and wanted to open up more space for more pets without having to euthanize adoptable kittens.  There are a lot of puppy and kitten caravans from states where spay and neuter are less common to states where there is a higher demand for pets.\n\nHowever,  there can be issues with this and pets (usually dogs) can be moved from state to state to escape a bite record, because the records don't move with the dog to the new animal control, though the shelters and rescues often know about the issues.    So for example in OP's case, if the dog's previous bite record was in MD, there would be no way animal control in MD would send a report to animal control in VA to be on the look out for this dog.  So when the dog attacked someone in VA it would only have the 1 bite on record and the dog would be less likely to be put down..  The fact OP knows about a previous bite and can give that info to animal control to find out about the previous bite makes a huge difference.  Some shelters are really great and some are skeazy, like it sounds like the one this dog came through.\n\nThere is a belief that moving dogs from state to state to escape a bite record is particularly true with pit bulls and pit bull rescues.  \n\nI hope this helps.", "score": 2}, {"id": "g5601tg", "body": "Contact a lawyer, you have a claim, at minimum for your medical bills.

Yes, call the police.\n\nUsually, I say talk to parents first.  I don't know if you would feel safe doing so in this situation, but that is what should have happened the first time.  It wasn't like they said something a little rude; that is sexual harassment even if a kid is doing it.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking to the parents or you do talk to the parents and the behavior doesn't stop, of course go talk to the police.  If you do nothing, it will continue, and it sounds like it is escalating.  I would expect the police will start with talking to the kids/parents.  You may have to keep calling if behavior continues.  Remember if you don't report again, you are telling the police that their initial measures worked and the problem is resolved.\n\nDocument everything.  Have your niece do the same.  Include dates and times.  Write up what happened in the past right now, and then add to it every time something happens even if it is little.  Photograph any damage.  Set up cameras outside as appropriate and legal.\n\nKeep yourself safe.  Keep doors locked and windows closed until this is resolved.  Be vigilant coming to and from home.  \n\nThe harassment is not good for a teenager girl.  I'd consider short term therapy or if your school is open having her talk to the school counselor.  She may need some help processing this and feeling safe.  (Part of her feeling safe is you need to persist until this stops.)  It may help you to do the same.\n\nAnother source may be CPS if you aren't getting any results with the police.  Clearly there is something going on wrong with these kids.  Six year olds don't typical yell at adults to sit on their dick - I'd start with reporting about the youngest kid.  If you know their addresses, making a report might trigger their family getting some help.\n\nFinally, I notice you said they ran off when your niece came.

On duty (engaged to wait): Where waiting is an integral part of the job, i.e., when the time spent waiting belongs to and is controlled by the employer and the employee is unable to use the time effectively for the employee\u2019s own purposes, that employee will be considered as engaged to wait. All time spent in activity where an employee is engaged to wait will be considered as part of hours worked.\n\n&gt; 2. Off duty (waiting to be engaged): Periods during which an employee is completely relieved from duty and which are long enough to enable the employee to use the time effectively for the employee\u2019s own purposes are not hours worked. The employee is not completely relieved from duty and cannot use the time effectively for the employee\u2019s own purposes unless the employee is told in advance that the employee may leave the job and that the employee will not have to commence work until a specified hour has arrived. Whether the time is long enough to enable the employee to use the time effectively for the employee\u2019s own purposes depends upon all of the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n&gt; 3. On-call time: An employee who is required to remain on-call on the employer\u2019s premises or so close thereto that the employee cannot use the time effectively for the employee\u2019s own purposes is working while \"on-call.\u201d An employee who is not required to remain on the employer\u2019s premises but is merely required to leave word at the employee\u2019s home or with company officials where the employee may be reached is not working while on-call.", "score": 2}, {"id": "g54jmtc", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1}, {"id": "g55jv6x", "body": "Thank you!

This might include HIV.\n\nSentence enhancement specific to HIV are laws that do not criminalize a behavior but increase the sentence length when a person commits certain crimes while infected with HIV.\n\nSentence enhancement specific to STD are laws that do not criminalize a behavior but increase the sentence length when a person commits certain crimes while infected with an STD. This might include HIV.\n\nNo HIV criminalization laws.\n\nGeneral criminal statutes, such as reckless endangerment and attempted murder, can be used to criminalize behaviors that can potentially expose another to HIV and or an STD.\n\nCriminalization of potential HIV exposure is largely a matter of state law, with some Federal legislation addressing criminalization in discrete areas, such as blood donation and prostitution. These laws vary as to what behaviors are criminalized or what behaviors result in additional penalties.\n\nIn 21 states, laws require persons who are aware that they have HIV to disclose their status to sexual partners and 12 states require disclosure to needle-sharing partners. \u00a0Several states criminalize one or more behaviors that pose a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission.\n\nThe maximum sentence length for violating an HIV-specific statute is also a matter of state law. Some states have a maximum sentence length as high as up to life in prison, while others have maximum sentence lengths that are less than 10 years. However, only 7 states have laws that account for HIV prevention measures that reduce transmission risk, such as condom use, and antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n\nSince 2014, at least five states have modernized their HIV criminal laws. Changes include removing HIV prevention issues from the criminal code and including them under disease control regulations, requiring intent to transmit, actual HIV transmission, or providing defenses for taking measures to prevent transmission such as viral suppression, condom use, and partner PrEP use.\n\n**Most North American prenatal care includes mandatory HIV tests, along with other STD/STI.

I'm also on mobile.\n\nMy parents divorced 2-3 years ago, and it was a pretty nasty and stressful divorce.\n\nMy dad is verbally abusive and has been physically and (I hope only just to me, it would be torture to me if he had done this to my brothers) sexually abusive in the past. Despite the efforts of me and my little brother sending multiple letters to the judge and begging my mom constantly to fight harder for us to stop going to his house, the judge that works on the case keeps filing in my dad's favor. According to my mom, he yelled at her in court and told her she was stupid for filing to restrict parenting time against my dad, which she had done because and my younger brother and I requested it.\n\nMy dad has been lying in court, saying that my younger brother and I love it at his house, and we're always excited to go. However, my dad refuses to get us basic everyday necessities (toiletries, clothes, etc.) that he has been court-ordered to get for us. He also ignores us all the time and provides no entertainment. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, he made us go over to his house for the weekend, and alas he ignored us again. I was stressed the entire weekend, and when I found out that he was making no plans to return us to our mom, I flipped. He had told the police (who had followed my mom to his house) that he wasn't planning on returning us to the 15th, and my mom hadn't been replying to his messages so he just went through with it without asking for an agreement. \n\nI became overly stressed because I never even wanted to be there in the first place, and there was some yelling back and forth. It ended while my dad was on the phone with the police, and my dad pushed me into a flight of stairs and threw a bucket that originally had my stuff in it at me. He was holding me down, and when he had pulled back his fist like he was going to punch me, I pushed him away with my feet. He told the police that I had assaulted him, and he wanted to press charges to throw me in jail. I had a panic attack in my room from the stress. Police didn't press charges, but he had to return me to my mom's house until the next court date, which was yesterday.\n\nThe court is giving him a month of \"makeup time\" starting today and made an order saying that my brother and I are not allowed to testify in court.\n\nThe cops have also told me to stop calling them because they think that it's a waste of their time.\n\nI'm afraid that my father is going to harm me and my little brother and make efforts to keep us away from our mom as long as possible. He also says rude things about my mom almost all the time, and I don't want him to alienate my little brother.\n\nWhat can I, a 17-year-old, do?\n\n\nTl;dr: A family court judge has put me and my brother in a situation where we're staying with my abusive father for a month and refuses to listen to us.", "score": 331, "comments": [{"id": "fupffzb", "body": "I think cps would be a better resource for you than the cops.

Since the boys have been removed before, they\u2019re obviously familiar with the family dynamics. If they choose to remove your nephews from their mother, they are legally obligated to make their priority providing services that will allow your nephew to safely return to her home (help her get into a treatment program, set up visits with the kids, psychological evaluation, etc). However, if they\u2019ve been placed by CPS outside their mother\u2019s home for a combined total of more than a year in the past five years, social services could choose to immediately file a petition to either terminate her parental rights or to transfer custody to a relative.\n\n2) File a private CHIPS petition. It\u2019s the same as what CPS would do, but if you contact them, and they decide the boys are old enough to keep themselves relatively safe without a sober caregiver, you could proceed on this yourself. It doesn\u2019t mean CPS doesn\u2019t care; it\u2019s likely they have kids in more dangerous circumstances than your nephews and the social workers are already carrying high caseloads. Again, if they haven\u2019t been in out of home placement for more than a year, the court is required to order services to help reunite the children with their mother. \n\n3) Depending on how long and how recently the nephews were in their grandmother\u2019s care, she may qualify to file for custody as a \u201cde facto custodian\u201d or as an \u201cinterested third party.\u201d These are statutory definitions, and you\u2019d want an attorney\u2019s assistance in filing a motion for custody under either one.\n\n4) Easiest and simplest, if you can get mother to agree that it\u2019s best for your nephews to live with their grandmother, you can have an attorney sit down with all of you to draft a custody agreement.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fuq5mfm", "body": "If you look up \u2018Minnesota kinship care\u2019 you will find a number of agencies that may be able to help you. \n\nThis is also one of the situations (deceased parent) where filing for grandparent\u2019s rights may be possible.", "score": 1}]}, {"id": "h86hxk", "title": "I am a cook and I was given a wage deduction without my consent", "body": "Hello!

The previous owners had a fence, but the rear portion did not extend across the very back of the property and instead stopped some 20-30 feet away.\n\nWe had a property survey done to determine where the back property line was (since the old fence didn't run along it) and learned that our property extends back farther than we originally thought. The neighbors behind us, who have lived in their home for about six years, were surprised as well, and are now raising concerns about our plans to install the new fence.\n\nThere are two specific concerns that the neighbor has raised.\n\n* Our property line sits four feet from their concrete driveway. When discussing the matter with our neighbor he brought up something which he termed \"easement to an existing structure\" (a term I'd never heard) and claimed that since his driveway is a structure which existed prior to my plan to install this fence, there are laws/ordinances pertaining to the distance any structure I build must be from his existing structure. I couldn't find much online about this term, but it's possible I don't have the right legal vocabulary to search properly. When it comes to property lines, is there an easement I need to be concerned about and, if so, what? I checked my Warranty Deed and it states \"The subject property is subject to easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions of record and/or in existence.\" How do I determine what these might be?\n\n\n* Along the whole back portion of my property, including along the property line, is much foliage. In particular along the property line, there is a lot of overgrown honeysuckle and other smallish trees that kind of form a green privacy barrier of sorts between us. In order to install the new fence, much of this foliage needs to be cleared. My question is about what I am allowed to clear. I've heard that if a tree is on my neighbor's side but branches of it extend over to my side, I am allowed to trim those branches back. Is that true? And what about trees that sit directly on the property line? Who is allowed to do what with them? I really don't want to remove something I'm not legally allowed to and have my neighbor get more upset.\n\n\nWhen Monday rolls around I plan to engage the local government in some way to learn more, but in the meantime I thought I'd get a head start and see if anyone here knows anything or has had similar experiences.

Interestingly enough, one of the definitions in the document is for \u201cStructures\u201d. And it says (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt; STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires more or less permanent location in or on the ground or attachment to something having a permanent location in or on the ground, including buildings, mobile homes, walls, signs, and fences, **but not including earthworks, ditches, canals, dams, reservoirs, pipelines, telephone or telegraph or electric power lines, driveways, or curbs.**\n\nOP\u2019s neighbor is claiming their driveway is a structure, but driveways are *explicitly* excluded from the definition of a structure in their zoning ordinance. It would seem that if there is a setback requirement for structures, OP\u2019s neighbor is mistaken in thinking his driveway is subject to that setback.\n\nSo...I guess nobody would *have* to move, at least not based on what his neighbor is saying. That said, I haven\u2019t read all 195 pages of the zoning regs, so there could be something else in there that affects this situation.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, building codes are different than zoning regulations. Zoning regs, which we\u2019re talking about here, generally deal with planning. For example, sizes of parcels of land in different sections of town, size and configuration of commercial signs, how far away from property lines structures can be, etc. Building codes are specific rules that must be followed in the construction of buildings, and cover things like framing, plumbing, electrical, fire ratings, ADA compliance, etc.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fuofws4", "body": "Thanks for the detailed answer, so I guess build the fence and tell the neighbour to pound sand if everything is as seems.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fuog0g6", "body": "I would say so, with the disclaimer that the zoning ordinance should be read, and a phone call to the zoning department wouldn\u2019t hurt either.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fuoghq9", "body": "OP, I would suggest you read through the zoning ordinances for your town that someone linked below.

Yes, this is LA, and I am NAL, but my own lawyer's advice for property boundary peace aligns well with my grandfather's: be firm, be respectful, and be kind to each other. In practice, this meant finding surveyed and staked property lines (locate the PIN; the stake is often just there to indicate a nearby iron post or pin as indicated by \"IP\" on a survey.) Invite your neighbor to commission their *own* survey if they are not in agreement with any discoveries as to boundary.  Build *around* features, such as trees, ancient rock walls, etc. so as to maintain peace where possible. \n\nBuild any fences a comfortable distance *inside* your property line if possible. This protects you in many ways. It's YOUR fence; they cannot  paint it pink. Or worse: paint your pink fence black on their side, leaving you looking at evil drips. You get to choose the style, material and height. They cannot lean stuff up against it.  If they build a structure right up against it, you have built in enormous legal leverage, as this would be encroaching. \n\nPeekaboo openings in fences to maintain the health and appearance of non-dangerous trees is a wise investment wherever possible; this gains huge karma points on Reddit, with the tree owner/co-owner, and with any other neighbors who see this effort expended. Allied neighbors are a good thing to have in your back pocket should any local support be needed in future for variance, to oppose obnoxious building extensions, etc. \n\nAlso, these things can cause multi-generational bad feelings over the most ridiculous disputes. Always take the high road, and if you can afford it use your attorney to communicate any concerns in writing if your next door grouch tries to take advantage of you after friendly conversation ceases to be productive.

The abuse CANNOT know she is thinking about leaving. \n\nShe needs to get legal representation for the divorce. Local domestic violence groups can help her. That lawyer can help her with legal stuff like restraining orders, custody, and the divorce. DV groups may have a low cost or free lawyer program. \n\nHere\u2019s my social work, practical advice (not strictly legal but important)\n\nCalling the DV groups on her phone could be dangerous, so she should not call on any phone to which he has access. I know you said your family doesn\u2019t have a lot of money. If you and your family can pull together ~$50 you should be able to get her a cheap prepaid phone and a nicer phone for more money. This phone should not be anywhere he can find it. See if she can leave it at work or you can get it or something. When she leaves she should leave her current phone at their home. Have her send anything important to the cloud or you if it is safe. \n\nSomeone will need to find her a place to go. Domestic Violence Shelters will keep her safe and are fairly restrictive out of necessity. If she does not want to go to a shelter and goes to a friends or family members home that he knows about she and the people she is staying with could be in danger. The best thing is for her to go to a place that he doesn\u2019t know about. Maybe a new apartment or a friend of the family. \n\nAny documentation of the abuse could prove helpful in getting a restraining order and to keep custody after the divorce. She can take pictures on a phone he cannot access. Have them sent to you or backed up on the cloud. Pictures of any cameras that she can safely get. Pictures on her second phone of texts and emails. \n\nShe will need her and her child\u2019s legal documents eventually. IF she can get them out of the home and to a safe person safely she should do so. This likely means taking them with them when she leaves. If she can\u2019t do that but has pictures of the documents that\u2019s fine for right now. If she can\u2019t do this her life is more important. After she leaves she will need to lock her credit there is a sticky on r/personalfinance that talks about that more. \n\nShe likely won\u2019t have access to their money once she leaves. If she has a personal account she can move that money when she is in a safe place. She should be able to call the institution and lock down that money when she leaves. \n\nShe and the child will need to leave when he is away. She may have no time so getting a small supply of things at your home or another trusted persons home that can be brought to her wherever will be helpful. Think shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, tampons, hair brush, clothes, and diapers. \n\nSome states and cities have domestic violence leave for someone leaving a DV situation. If she has that, great! Use it. If not going to work can be dangerous and she should arraigned for some time off, WFH, or a transfer to a different location. \n\nHe may have trackers on the car, in any case he will likely be able to recognize the car, so she should leave it or hide it away from where she is staying. \n\nHer safety is the priority here and this is fairy general advice. Someone who works for a DV group can provide more specifics. \n\nDomestic Violence hotlines are not only for the person being abused. You can call and get more loca guidance for her. They may have funds and items available since leaving is expensive. To get connected you can use google or call the United Way\u2019s 211\n\nEdited to Add:\nPolice may help but they may put her in more danger if they don\u2019t arrest.

They can have everything she needs packed, loaded, and gone within a few hours while her husband is at work.\n\n2. Storage facilities will aid women escaping abuse, usually a first month free 24hr gates &amp; code facility is best - but in another city.\n\n3. Police will come to a house where a woman is leaving an abusive relationship and will guard her while she packs. If not them, local groups such as former military and bikers will stand guard.\n\n4. Get her a burner phone that she can only use outside the house. Find a neighbor or a friend nearby who can hide it for her. Don't ever let her use it while the other phone is nearby.\n\n5. If the cameras are wifi enabled, she can contact the ISP or tell the police using the burner phone, and one of them will disable the wifi in the house so she isn't seen touching it, and the cameras will not send the feed as long as it is down.\n\n6. All that's needed now is a distraction for the husband - possibly in another county - that will keep him at bay long enough to execute the plan.\n\n7.

So she can't appear to be changing her routine, she needs to do it in a way that he can sit at home tracking her &amp; not suspect a thing. That's a hard thing to do, abusers don't like losing their playthings &amp; that's pretty much what he is to her. A puppet he can manipulate, control, use as a punchbag, say do whatever he wants. She's so much more &amp; deserves someone who knows that &amp; is the opposite of him.\n\nIn her favour is that he's a cheating POS on top of everything else, they have a young child &amp; she has people who care for her, like you.\n\nSo like others have said she needs a plan, she needs to get  certain things set up before leaving, without him suspecting a thing. So she needs to have a reason for her &amp; LO  to leave the house for hours at a time without POS. Well as a mother of two sons I am well aware of how much energy 1 year old boys have, well one year olds in general. So as things open up again, mother &amp; toddler groups, going to park.  Her husband might want to come along at first,  but he'll realise he can better use that time having sex with his mistress.\n\nYou need to buy her a pre-paid  phone, assume that he is listening in at all times via her phone. Because he could he anytime he wants depending on what he's done to her phone. Assume he's able to track that phone &amp; their car, don't let her devices connect to your wifi or your to their's. Don't log into any of her accounts on your devices or log into yours on any of hers, assume he has a keylogger. She cam use the prepaid phone to make calls &amp; have messages left on, but it's safest to leave it with you until she leaves. \n\n\nWomen's shelters, victim support, victim advocates will be able to provide her with details of exactly what help &amp; support is available. As well as what information she'll need to provide, how to gather evidence &amp; create the paper trail, recommendations for lawyers &amp; so on. She will need somewhere safe to keep this information which you could offer to do. You could look up the contact details for her or let her look it up. She should create a new email, unrelated to her current ones, she should never log into it or check it from her own devices or on any her husband has access to. Obviously she can't mention it in her home, car, when she has her phone or anything with her. My friends ex-husband actually listened into our conversations via whatever app that he put on her phone. He also used a keylogger on it to access our wifi assuming we wouldn't be able to check. He just couldn't resist mentioning things, so we'd know he'd been listening. We had lots of fun messing with his head.\n\nWhat that means is when she makes the calls has meetings, she needs to leave everything but her clothes &amp; prepaid phone elsewhere. If she has their car, she needs to park it wherever hubby thinks she's going, leave her phone there too &amp; get a cab or uber there, pay in cash for it. Remembering not to say or do anything that could tip him off. Her lawyer will be able to explain what she's entitled too &amp; how to prevent him hiding marital assets. The initial consultation is free, so she should go with a list of questions &amp; whatever proof &amp; paperwork she has. \n\n\nYou need to take photos of her injuries, she needs to write everything down. If there's hospital records get copies. Police reports if they exist. All of which can help her get a restraining order if she needs one after she leaves him. When she leaves him having good home security will really make her feel safe. She should also look into support groups &amp; therapy, it's important to talk it over, to break the BS they tell you. It's not her fault,  it isn't because he loves her so much, he might have said he was sorry  it doesn't mean he is. Nothing she said or did is the reason,  he's an abusive POS that's why he's done all he has &amp; he won't stop or get better. She has to leave. She's lucky to have your support. She's taken the first steps, by admitting what's happening. I use that word as abusers always play the victim card, as if it's their fault they abused you.

You can either google or call 211 and ask for DC resources in your area). \n\n\nWhen filing for a TRO with a child, the judge will only grant one to a minor if they feel like the minor is at risk (for example, has he beat her in front of the child? Showed signs of anger or verbally abuse her? Does his patience run short w the kid as well?). Make sure when filing for a TRO, she sticks with facts and leaves her opinion out (I.E. on 6/10 he came home from work and saw dishes in the sink, he made a comment about me being worthless then shoved my face in the sink).

Once I got the TRO granted, the police escorted me back to my apartment to gather my belongings and serve him. Police stayed the whole time, to ensure I was safe and he was out of the room while I packed.

In *Byrne v. Avon Products,* 328 F.3d 379 (7th Cir.2003), this court held that either an employee's inability to communicate his illness to his employer or clear abnormalities in the employee's behavior may constitute constructive notice of a serious health condition. *Id.* at 381-82. **\"It is enough under the FMLA if the employer knows of the employee's need for leave; the employee need not mention the statute or demand its benefits.\"** ***Id.*** **at 382.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... Under the FMLA a covered employee may have up to twelve weeks of leave during any twelve month period if the employee is suffering from a **\"serious health condition\" which makes him \"unable to perform the functions of \\[his\\] position.\"** 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a)(2)(i). A serious health condition is one which requires \"**inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility\" or continuing treatment by a health care provider**. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(11). The continuing treatment test for a serious health condition is met if an employee is incapacitated by \"an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition\" for more than three consecutive days and for which he is treated by a health care provider on two or more occasions. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a)(2)(i).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...

I have some experience with family law, but it was a few years ago. \n\n1) Gonna reiterate everyone else's suggestion that you call DFCS, the Department of Children and Family Services (Louisiana's version of CPS). They have a child abuse hotline. They need to know about the baths and the fact that they all sleep in the same bed. \n\n2) The judge is probably letting your sister continue to have overnight visits because your niece's dad hasn't yet asked to amend their custody agreement (or he has asked/filed a motion to amend it, but the judge hasn't ruled on it yet). This could be tricky depending on which part of LA you're in; not all courts are open yet. I know a few judges are still managing their dockets remotely but I have no idea how they're managing that in family courts. \n\n3) Just because yall have been telling everyone that the sex offender is living there doesn't mean the court actually knows that. You say your neice's father \"reports\" everything, but what exactly do you mean by that? Who does he report it to? I clerked for a judge for a few years and can tell you that we'd get calls allllll the time from pro se litigants (people representing themselves) who wanted to complain about something in their case. Even if they have the best complaint in the world, the judge can't really do anything about if you don't file a motion to ask the court to do something and include some supporting evidence. I'd be happy to explain this in more detail if you'd like. \n\n4) Again, it's very important to have physical proof that he's living there (multiple time-stamped pictures of his car in the driveway would be a good start) and your niece's father needs to show that to the court (or have his attorney do it). Even better if you can get pictures of his car there when she has visitation. Witness testimony is OK, but physical proof is better. It can also make cases get heard more quickly- sometimes a hearing will have to be pushed back to another date if you need witness testimony, because they have to make sure they set the hearing on a date when everyone can attend. \n\n5) The fact that your sister is planning on moving to Texas and not returning is really important. You need to make sure that your niece's father knows that and that he tells the court (or that his attorney tells the court). From what I remember, a parent planning to leave the state without informing the court/the other parent was treated as a big deal by family court judges. \n\n6) I think it's against this sub's rules to recommend any legal services, but I'm not sure if that applies to legal aid services since some of them are quasi-governmental (mods: please let me know if you consider this to be against the rules and I'll edit this part out). At any rate, I can tell you with certainty that there are legal aid clinics in Louisiana that will take custody cases for low-income people if your niece's father meets the income requirements. He'll have to apply; you can't do it for him since you're not the parent. And he'll probably have to pay for the filing costs since they usually can't cover that, but it'll hopefully only be a few hundred dollars max vs. thousands if you hired a private attorney.", "score": 660}, {"id": "ftqqo7m", "body": "[removed]", "score": -1}, {"id": "ftqrtva", "body": "You need to call CPS.

And I babysat them a lot of times in these last two years when their mother was busy or their parents were having a date or something. And although the 7 year old could bath herself just fine, the little one needed help. Yes, the case op is talking is just fucked up and the op sister shouldn't be allowed to have unsupervised visits with her kid (I was molested when I was a kid and I'm very protective of the children around me) but I just wanted to be clear that is common for a 5 years old kid having problems with showering.", "score": 17}, {"id": "ftr37my", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1}, {"id": "ftr39an", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1}, {"id": "ftr39hj", "body": "[removed]", "score": 2}, {"id": "ftr3ffh", "body": "*Your post may have been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\n**Speculative, Anecdotal, Simplistic, Off Topic, or Generally Unhelpful**\n\nYour comment has been removed because it is one or more of the following: speculative, anecdotal, simplistic, generally unhelpful, and/or off-topic.

Get a professional on your side.  Religious personnel are usually easiest because they are free, but a financial advisor may be willing to do a free consultation and often mental health counseling is available through your insurance for a small fee.  That said, if at all possible work with as many people as possible.  The more voices you have, the better you will be heard.\n\n\\- Get a PO Box and, if possible, a bank box/ safety deposit box to store your documents.  Open an account at a credit union your parents do not use.  Credit unions tend to give far more options and be lower cost than banks. \n\n\\- Get your birth certificate and social security card from legal government sources.  Send it to the PO Box.\n\n\\- Let them know, in writing, that you will not be committing fraud for them.  Make sure that you get the replies in writing. \n\n\\- Create a plan for independent living.  This includes government resources such as health insurance, shelters, food.  Generally the financial aid office looks for evidence you have all your \"ducks\" in a row, not who is actually footing the bill.  Of course, having a job will look much better.\n\n\\- Go to your colleges financial aid office with any threats.  Using the leverage of the professional that you are working with let them now that you are unable to get a loan, get their taxes, etc.   because abuse and fraud is involved a good financial aid officer should be able to walk you through the dependance override process so you are declared an independent student.", "score": 6}, {"id": "ftpmr9m", "body": "Thank you!

It is likely your parents don't understand what the loan is and how it is to be used.\n\nLastly, get the records you need and get a bank account opened at a different bank than your parents.

House is under contract to sell and one party is now threatening to take all the profit [ME]", "body": "So messy situation with multiple players. There's my boyfriend, his late fiancee, late fiancees father (father-in-law here on out), and late fiancees stepmom (mother-in-law here on out).\n\nHistory: Boyfriend and late fiancee move out here to move their business. Property has a house and a building for the business to run out of. Father and mother-in-law help purchase the property with the understanding that it's an investment into the business which they will get partial ownership of. Late fiancee unfortunately passes away. Her portion of the business goes to Father-in-Law and her biomother. \n\nBusiness does well and moves to a new location. Property is transformed so that boyfriend and inlaws can all live on the property. Boyfriend pays 50% of mortage, and inlaws pay other 50%. Time goes buy and they decide to sell the house. Plan discussed was to split the profit so 50% goes to boyfriend, and 50% goes to inlaw couple. In-laws try to get money from business for the improvements made to the property when the business was still there, treating it like loan. Business (and lawyers) say no, it wasn't a loan it was an investment and you are a partial owner of the business as well. Money stays where it is. \n\nFast forward. House has a buyer. Plan is to do the 50% split. Now Father-in-Law tells boyfriend that since the in-laws put money into the house for the business, they want to get that money back. End result is that they will be keeping the full profits from the house. They will take 100% and boyfriend will get 0%.\n\nBasically after working with the title people, I was told that they will be writing three checks, 33% in each, one addressed to each owner. There will be a paper all three have to sign to agree. If someone refuses to sign it goes to an attorney for mediation. We haven't told this to the in-laws yet. \n\nBasically I'm asking if there is any advice on what other steps we can take. The goal is to lay out to the in-laws that moving forward with trying to take 100% of the profits will not work and the best case scenario is that they'll get 66% of the profits, but they will have to wait it out through a long messy process. Boyfriend and I have somewhere to stay for free while we wait this process out, so we have the time and money for a long battle. They do not. \n\nWe don't want to have it get to that point though and are looking for anything we can lump on there to make them realize that this is a very very bad idea.\n\nFollow-up: If the house is sold in the second week of the month but before the 15th, do we still need to pay the full month of mortgage payment or is it reduced? In-laws, before they said they were taking 100% of the profits, asked if we could pay our portion of the mortgage for next month early to help them with moving expenses they are running into now. Boyfriend did to be nice and then they hit him with this whole threat of taking all the profits as well.

She has even gone to the lengths of asking us to change our cleaning routines because she doesn't like the smell of our products.\n\nSo a few weeks go by and we find a bedbug in our room, initially we just ask the neighbors if she has had any problems with them before but she claimed they were from the previous tenants.

That is illegal.\n\nBut in your case your father is on the title, and presumably the mortgage (I find it unlikely the bank would issue you and your wife a loan and allow you to take on a partner on the title without their liability for the loan).\n\nHow long have you owned the home? Has it gained enough equity to cover his investment? \n\nIf not, you are stuck with your dad as a partner at least until it gains enough equity (or you can buy him out). As someone else suggested, place the home in a trust with instructions for how to deal with a sale or death. However, if your father has liabilities, they can come after his portion of the home.\n\nBUT if there is enough equity, you could possibly refinance and cash out his portion, and pay him out. This will raise your mortgage.  But it will allow you to pay out your parents and remove them from the loan and the title.\n\nAfter that point, if they still want to loan you the money to offset the mortgage payments, you should speak to a lawyer. It's probably OK, as the bank would be paid ahead of your parents, but this is beyond my pay grade.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fton2px", "body": "Yeah... your parents didn't give you a gift.

Kemp, 979 N.E.2d 678 (Ind.App. 2012)   \n\n\n The trial court reviewed the nuisance claims by reviewing Indiana law  which states a nuisance is defined as: \\[w\\]hatever is: (1) injurious to  health; (2) indecent; (3) offensive to the senses; or (4) an obstruction  to the free use of property; so as essentially to interfere with the  comfortable enjoyment of life or property\u2026.Ind.Code \u00a7 32\u201330\u20136\u20136 (2002).  Nuisances may be either public or private. A public nuisance is one  which affects an entire neighborhood or community, while a private  nuisance affects only \\[a\\] single person or a determinate number of  people. The essence of a private nuisance is the use of property to the  detriment of the use and enjoyment of another\u2019s property. Both public  and private nuisances are further subdivided into nuisances per se, or  nuisances at law, and nuisances per accidens, or nuisances in fact. A  nuisance per se, as the term implies, is that which is a nuisance in  itself, and which, therefore, cannot be so conducted or maintained as to  be lawfully carried on or permitted to exist. Thus, for example, a  house of prostitution and an obstruction that encroaches on the  right-of-way of a public highway are nuisances per se. On the other  hand, an otherwise lawful use may become a nuisance per accidens by  virtue of the circumstances surrounding the use. To recover in a  nuisance action the complaining party need show only inconvenience,  annoyance, or discomfort. Noise may be a nuisance if it is unreasonable  in its degree, and reasonableness is a question of fact.", "score": 3}, {"id": "ftmw0u2", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1}]}, {"id": "h089cb", "title": "Unbearable smell coming from apartment below us", "body": "There is a horrible burning plastic smell that has filled our apartment once a week for the past 5 weeks; this week has now been twice.  We have been in contact with the leasing office for the apartment complex several times.  We confronted different neighbors last week and no one could smell it.  When we confronted our downstairs neighbor, as soon as the door opened we could smell it.  She claimed it was bad firewood from Seven Eleven.  It is June and around 60\u00b0F at night; we do not believe this is firewood.  The smell always starts between 9 P.M. and 2 A.M. and takes hours to air out of our apartment.  It also causes us to wake us up in the middle of the night.\n\nWe have suspicions that it might be the smell of smoking crack, but so far the apartment people haven't done anything besides call our neighbors to ask them if they smelled anything.  Is there anything else that we can do because we can't take it anymore.\n\nLocation: Oregon\n\nUpdate:  Just received a call from leasing office stating that they would launch an investigation to find out where the smell is coming from.  They mentioned that they called the apartment below us and that they had smelled the same thing.  I have a 5-6 week old email chain stating the different times that we smelled the burning plastic smell, so hopefully they will be able to figure out what it is.
