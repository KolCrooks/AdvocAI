We had no problems with the car and we were set to return it Friday morning. Thursday night we parked the car a few blocks from our house . Our neighborhood has basically no parking so we had to park near a fire hydrant about 6 feet away **which is illegal but does not warrant a tow only a ticket** from the city. It was extremely late and we were exhausted so we just said fuck it, we'll pay the ticket if it comes to that. We were not parked in a tow zone, in front of a driveway, none of that.\n\nThe next morning the car was gone. I called the nearest precinct and they said the NYPD did not tow it but they have a citywide database so they found out who towed it - A private towing company, lets call them Terrible Towing Company (TTC). I called TTC and they told me  **I could not come get the car not even my personal belongings inside it ,** and that only the rental company could come get it as they owned the car not me.  **TTC also told me that the rental company had called it in to be towed,** which did not make sense because I had just spoken to the rental company, letting them know I was on my way to return the car, and they said okay no problem.\n\nThis is where it gets weird. I called the rental company and let them know what had happened. They said **they did not call it in to be towed** . I told them okay I will file a complaint at the precinct and try my best to get the car back on Monday (my actual car got out the shop on Monday and the tow company is very far away so I couldn't use regular public transportation).\n\nFast forward to Monday: Me and my boyfriend go to the precinct. They tell us we can't file a regular criminal complaint because it's technically not larceny. We have to file a complaint with the DCA or BBB and bring it to small claims court.  Mind you the cop also says \"This happens a lot in this neighborhood...Hating neighbors call the cops on each other all the time for petty things\" ... (Me and my bf just moved over here).\n\nThen we drove to the tow yard. Nobody was there and gates are closed so can't see inside. I called the tow company, and the guy tells me \"**The bank took the car to Long Island. It got repossessed.** You can't get it or get your things from inside, only the rental company can do that.\" I try to press him and tell him that he lied to me, the rental company did not call the car to be towed, and it did not get repossessed. He tells me talk to the rental company, not his problem. I say where did the bank take the car. He says talk to the rental company. Etc...\n\nSo. I call the rental company. They tell me the tow company is lying, it's impossible that the car got repossessed, etc., and furthermore the rental company would know if the bank took it and nobody notified them.\n\nHERE'S THE THING. The rental company charges per day. I am racking up $500 and counting in extra rental fees that I am not financially prepared for, not to mention possible tow fees that they might try to hit me with. How can I resolve this legally? Is there a way I can sue the tow truck company in small claims court and have them pay the cost of my rental fees? Can I even put a larger lawsuit together from other people who have been victim to their illegal towing?\n\nAlso note: The reviews of the towing company is hilarious.

In short: if there's no A/C there's no outside air, which means boss-lady is violating IMC code which in turn is law as adopted by the Washington legislature.\n\nNote further that this section does not allow for building operators to simply kill the A/C, throw the doors open (fresh air!), and use fans as described.

It likely isn't sealed to the point where make up air is needed.*\n\nAn old, poorly sealed building is ***exactly*** the type of building you would want to use an HVAC/R with fresh air intakes.  Think about it: if your old building **doesn't** have an outside air intake (which then mixes with return air before crossing the evaporator coil, at which point the moisture condenses out and is drained away), your only other option is to pull in unconditioned outside air through every one of those poorly-sealed crevices you're thinking of and eventually get it to the return air grilles.  Along the way it's going to condense, sweat, and cause IAQ problems not least of which is unchecked, potentially unseen mold growth.\n\nIn the first scenario you can keep your building slightly positively pressurized, but in the second your building is going to be negatively pressurized.  Negatively pressurized buildings suck in moisture-laden unconditioned air and ultimately have the IAQ issues I mentioned above.  It's true that makeup air is necessary to control CO2 levels, but you'll create bigger problems if the makeup air isn't conditioned first.  This is why mechanical engineers always design buildings to be slightly positively pressurized with very, very rare exceptions.  This is Mechanical Design 101 type of stuff.\n\n&gt;*(2).

I have an open case for custody ongoing right now. We've had had a couple of hearings since with the only orders being that I get 3 phone calls a week with my daughter, preferably by video, but due to some tech issues, these are done mostly as a regular phone call that I do record to use for reference in keeping a journal of our conversations. Tonight, I called at our normal time window and chatted with my daughter about her weekend and asked how her brother was doing and she said fine. I then asked if he is doing anything to annoy her, and she told me that he was playing with his penis in front of her again.

He was there for 2 days and they called me to tell me that he passed.\n\nI have the phone conversations recorded. They claim that they gave him his shots Sat night, Sunday Morning/Night, and then today when they came in he was lethargic and they knew something was wrong. They checked his glucose level and it was 23. They claim they gave him IV and then shortly after he had a 5 second seizure, but then pepped up, and died shortly after.\n\nI asked \"what was his glucose levels the last 2 days?\". They responded with \"we never took his glucose levels\". I asked \"how much was he eating before this happened\". They responded with \"they were feeding him dry so they weren't sure how much he was eating\". They overdosed my cat on insulin and had no idea whether he needed it. I can't imagine a situation where a vet could knowingly give a cat insulin without knowing whether he was eating or what his levels were. He was young, healthy, and fine before this. You bring a cat to board at a vet because you expect them to treat their health professionally. I got no calls, no warnings. If they called me yesterday and said \"he hasn't been eating- his glucose levels are low so we don't feel comfortable dosing him\", I would have left vacation and came home for him. I would have had a relative pick him up and bring him home. I know how glucose levels float around with diabetic cats. I see his levels spike every time I bring him for a checkup or shots. I have never seen his levels go below 150. He always floated around 175-200 and sometimes at the vet that number would jump to 250 or more.\n\nI really can't fathom how this could have happened. Am I wrong or is this blatant malpractice? Anyone have any advice? I feel so guilty that I trusted this institution with my animal. If I never left he would still be alive. His main vet would never administer insulin without knowing his glucose levels. He also always advised that if I didn't see him to eat then I shouldn't administer insulin because his levels could drop. They a.) didn't monitor his eating b.) check his glucose levels till it was too late. These are the 2 biggest NO-NOs when it comes to a diabetic animal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also add that I live in New York and the reason we brought him here is because they call themselves a \" Veterinary Hospital Pet Resort and Spa\" and that my cat would have an entire 4'x10' room to himself where he would be cared for by vets. \n\nThanks for any help.", "score": 39, "comments": [{"id": "fypv9ua", "body": "I\u2019m sorry about the loss of your cat.

We share the same mother. I'm 25, and I've been like a second mother to her since she was born. My mother and I have noticed that she's been running with a bad crowd and decided to catch her off-guard and take her computer while she was still logged on. We had already confiscated her phone and put her on restriction. \n\nI noticed that she had her Snapchat login information saved into the browser. Like any person trying to figure out why their smart, bright young sister was skipping homework assignments and getting into trouble, I logged in, changed the password to her Snapchat so I could open the app on my phone. Sorry, that might be confusing to some of you unfamiliar with the app. \n\nWe found vapes of various kinds in her room a few weeks ago. Mostly cheap $15 disposable ones. More than anything I wanted to get to the bottom of where she was getting these things from. To my horror, it wasn't long before I found messages from a guy named Bob. She messaged him asking if he could bring her some \"nic\"\n\nHe told her that he was broke and didn't have enough gas to get all the way to our house, but she reassured him that she would pay for his gas if he came by our house first. She gave him our address. He came by our house, picked up the $30 she stole from our wallets, went to a head shop to buy the vapes, and then brought them back to her. It's all in the messages. \n\nThis meant he was old enough to drive and was old enough to buy tobacco (21 in the US). It didn't take long for me to connect the dots between him and a conversation I had with my sister a few weeks ago about some guy that worked at a fast food chain restaurant. She said he was a creepy guy that talked to all of her friends, but primarily one named Anna (14). She brought it up in a way that made me think he was some teenager, but I was wrong. \n\nI immediately confronted her and she went into more detail about this creep. She confessed that she was afraid of him because he has a short temper, and her friend Anna was deeply involved with him. Apparently he picks Anna up in his van sometimes, and one of the times recently things went \"bad\" between them. Anna refused to tell my sister any more than that. Anna lives in our neighborhood, and my sister explained that part of the deal was that she gave Anna one of the vapes he dropped off. \n\nMy sister explained that since he's an alcoholic and works in fast food, he's broke and has a group of young girls and boys he threatens for these vapes so they get them any way possible. He'll take the vapes from them and give them to Anna and her younger sister because he has a crush on both of them and wants to control them. He also gives them marijuana. He has mentioned to these girls that he thinks age is just a number.\n\nI confronted him as soon as I saw those messages, and maybe I shouldn't have. I was so upset though. I called him a loser for getting gas money from a 12 year old girl. I told him never to contact her again. I plan on deleting that Snapchat profile anyways, but I'm keeping it as long as I need to for evidence. \n\nI plan on going to the authorities, but I realistically wanted to know what would happen. I have one of the vapes he gave her, the messages from his Snapchat profile to her, and I know where he works. \n\nMy sister agreed to answer any questions the police may have regarding him. I know when his shifts are, so I planned on waiting for him to drive in tomorrow so I could get his plate number. I don't know his last name. I feel so helpless. \n\nIf the authorities are no help, I want to go into the restaurant and speak with his manager when he's not there.

Never gave me title, then went out of business. I'm military; trying to register in Nevada. DTP suit pending, but can I get legal help fighting DMV issues?", "body": "*This post is a bit used-car heavy, but please see my specific legal questions near the bottom of the thread. \\[Cross-posted in* [r/askcarsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/), r/Austin and r/DMV\\]\n\n*TLDR: Dealership didn't give me title, then went out of business. Can't get duplicate title; scared to get bonded title for fear of having to repay bond. Can't register car and temp plates expired. Neither bank/financier, nor DMV, can resolve. Scroll to bolded text near the bottom for questions.*\n\n* Bought used car in Feb 2020. Dealership is in Austin, TX, but I'm not a Texas resident. (I'm military temporarily serving in Texas, but intend to register vehicle in Nevada.) Dealership didn't have title because they \"just got the car in, but title is coming and we'll send it to the Nevada DMV ASAP.\" I foolishly fell for it. My bank (USAA) paid them directly, and now I repay the loan monthly to USAA. I do have a bill of sale, and other related paperwork from the transaction (we-owe, odometer statement, etc,) ... just no title.\n* I kept pinging the dealership about title/registration. They avoided me for a few weeks, saying \"we're working it,\" but eventually they just decide to ghost me. (I don't live in Austin ... Visiting in person wasn't an easy option.)\n* I call USAA for help. They won't clawback the loan to allow me to take the car back. (Besides, dealership isn't obligated to take car back anyway.) USAA's stance is: They gave the money to me, not the dealership (even though they LITERALLY gave the money directly to the dealership.) I'm making monthly payments to USAA on a car I don't have a title for, even while USAA sends me periodic letters harassing me because they don't have the title for the loan (as the lienholder.)\n* Months go by. The temp plates the dealership gave me are expired. (Luckily, COVID-19 has caused some cities to issue waivers for expired registration, so I'm safe for now. But once the waiver expires, I won't have registration, nor temp tags.) I can purchase one 30-day tag from the DMV, but once it expires, I'll still be without registration, and the rules only allow ONE purchase of a temp tag. (I can't buy them multiple times back-to-back.)\n* I got a lawyer and also filed a complaint with Texas DMV Dealership Enforcement division. Texas Attorney General was not interested in helping; deferred to DMV. BBB is worthless. Military lawyers don't work these issues.\n* DMV investigator says dealership was not on the level, with multiple people having the same issue. The dealership acquired cars, but didn't make good on the titles. (I don't know exactly what this means ... Maybe the dealership financed the cars from an auction but didn't pay the auction house they bought them from?) Whatever the reason, the dealership was selling cars they knew they couldn't deliver titles on.\n\n(FYI: The car itself is fine. Carfax is clean, it's not salvaged; I had the car inspected before purchase, and I've been driving it since Feb, even took a cross-country road trip with no problems. I have no problems with the car itself, other than I can't register it because I don't have title.)\n\n* DMV investigator tells me the dealership is going out of business. (I guess they're pulling out out now before more people sue.) They weren't responsive to me anyway ... but now this means I have no hope of getting the dealership to make things right.\n* Lawyer files suit for Deceptive Trade Practices. (I'm still waiting for this to play out, but with dealer going out of business, I'm not expecting much to result from this. Maybe I win a default judgement that I can't collect.)\n\nI go to DMV to research options.\n\n* I can't request \"duplicate title,\" because duplicate titles are for when the CURRENT owner needs a copy of the current title s/he once had. (Since I never had the title in my name, I have no proof that I'm the current owner and can't request a duplicate.)\n* I research a \"bonded title,\" and learn that I could purchase a surety bond. This would allow me to get a bonded title, and register the car in Texas, but not Nevada. But, I also learn that in the event that someone else lays claim to the vehicle (say, the dealership, or the auction house that the dealer never paid,) then the bond will pay the previous claimant and I'd be required to repay the bondsman (while STILL replaying my USAA loan.) This would effectively make me financially liable for TWICE what I was expecting to pay for the car.\n* I complete a TX DMV form VTR-130 \"Notice of Determination for a Bonded Title,\" and the DMV annotates that there is no lien on the vehicle. I'm supposed to use this to purchase a surety bond, but I'm holding off for now, because I'm not sure I want to do this. Lawyer also advises me to hold off going this route in hopes other solutions arise.\n\nMy concern is that SOMEONE (either the auction house where the dealer got the car, or the dealer themselves) will claim to be the rightful owner, forcing me to repay the bond.\n\n* I was able to track down the previous owner, who says he traded in the vehicle to \"Covert Autogroup\" dealership in Dec 2019. Since I bought the car in Feb 2020, this leaves about two months where Covert must've sold the car to either the dealership or an auction. I've tried calling Covert twice ... I can't easily go there in person, and each time I call and ask for the finance/title dept, I get transferred to a voicemail that is unanswered. (Even if I was to reach a human, I doubt they will help me anyway.)\n\nI assume there's a *reason* the dealer didn't give me a title, and I need to pinpoint who might claim ownership of the car. I think I need to find who the dealer purchased the car from, and somehow get proof that they no longer have an interest in the vehicle (or, at least confirm that they DO have an interest in the vehicle, which will confirm my suspicion that I shouldn't buy a surety bond.)\n\n***My general questions, in bold:***\n\nIf Covert Autogroup (who accepted the car from the previous owner as a trade-in) isn't responsive, ***how can I find out who the dealer bought the car from?*** (Carfax shows that a title was issued/update in Jan 2020, but has no info about to whom.)\n\nIf I FIND them, ***WHAT exactly am I asking them to do that will make things right?*** Sign some form? Give me a letter of release of interest?\n\nIf I choose to move forward with a bonded title, remember that I'm military and intended to register in Nevada ... Nevada won't accept bonded titles for out-of-state registrations, and I understand Texas won't allow transfers of bonded titles out of state. I'm not a TX resident, but I guess I could attempt to register in Texas and that might work for a bit. But I'm soon scheduled to leave Texas (for my next duty assignment,) and will no longer be physically in the state for the required 3-5 years a bonded title needs to be maintained. My driver's license and insurance are with my home state of Nevada ... ***Should I attempt to register in Texas if I'm not a resident, won't be in the state, and have no intention of returning to Texas? If Nevada won't accept a bonded title, I'm not sure how else I can register.***\n\n***Finally, if I'm tired of fighting, how can I just wash my hands of this?*** If:\n\n* ... I'm willing to concede there is no acceptable resolution;\n* ... if I don't want to risk getting a bonded title and having to repay the surety bond and be liable for twice the amount of the car;\n* ... if I can't register in Nevada with a bonded title;\n* ... if I shouldn't register in Texas because I'm not a resident and won't be in the state for the 3-year bonded title requirement;\n* ... if my lawsuit results in default judgement I can't collect from a bankrupt dealership;\n* ... if I'm willing to repay USAA the auto loan anyway ...\n\n... What can I do with the car? I assume I can't sell a car I don't appear to legally own, yet it's a perfectly fine car.

Don\u2019t push them for quicker results, just emphasize getting a real and firm timeline that you can hold them to. Discuss work hours and notification for unit access re: work. Ask that the $500 be at a rate of $1,000 per month paid biweekly until work is completed.

Unfortunately, it is entirely too common. The first thing I would do is go to the bank and see if you can take your money out.\n\nI understand you don't want to go back, and I can understand why, so you need to look for alternative solutions.\n\nIf you can communicate with your parents, I suggest you remind them that they have broken the law by kicking you out and they can get in a lot of trouble for doing so. You could call CPS on them and they would likely be forced to take you back in and could be looking at various charges, which they no doubt don't want. If there are other children in the household, once CPS gets involved, they look at everything. Normally, I would tell someone in your situation to contact CPS, a teacher, guidance counselor, or other adult for help. If you contact anyone official, they will have to report this to the government though, and you will need to think about whether that is best for you. However, if you need to go back home and you think you will be safe there, then if your parents are unwilling to budge, CPS is the answer.\n\nAt any rate, assuming there is no one else to take you in, I would suggest that you tell your parents that they would be best off renting a place for you and providing you with an allowance so you can care for yourself. That is not normally what I would suggest, but if you feel unsafe in your parents' home and you feel you can care for yourself, this might be the best way to go for you.\n\nYou can look into becoming emancipated. Here are the forms you will need to file in court [https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/forms/emancipation/](https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/forms/emancipation/)  If you become emanicpated, you should be able to rent an apartment.\n\nA number of folks have given you groups that can offer you help.

As they charged at me I yelled \"someone come get your dogs!\", but nobody came to help. I received a quick snap on my arm, but was wearing long sleeves and suffered no broken skin or real injury. My dog was bit up some, but nothing too serious.\n\nAlthough the attacking dogs seemed more interested in killing my dog than hurting me I was in fear of serious injury, especially because the \\~160 pounds of dogfight at my feet was knocking me off balance into my car, and if I fell I would be very vulnerable to being bitten on the head or neck.\n\nI was able to draw my legally carried handgun and shoot the larger and more aggressive dog once. After the shot, both dogs stopped attacking and ran off. My dog and I went back inside, where I made sure neither of us were seriously injured, and called 911. I went back outside while on the phone with the dispatcher to search my yard and my neighbors' yards to try to render aid to the dog if possible. A neighbor ran around the corner asking \"was that a gunshot?\" and \"where are my dogs?\" I pointed the direction the dogs ran and told her where they went, but didn't say anything about the gunshot. My gun was still on my hip, and emotions were clearly high for everyone, so I didn't want to be in a conversation with an angry dog owner about why I shot her dog.\n\nAn animal control deputy (in my county they are actually sworn LEOs who work for the Sheriff) responded to the call, asked for a written report, and took photos showing the saliva left on my sleeve from the bite. As I was in the driveway speaking to the deputy the woman drove up and yelled at me, asking why I shot her dog. The deputy took the woman's information and told her to get the dog to the vet. The deputy told me that the shooting was, as far as his criminal investigation goes, entirely justified and that he would be filing his report as a response to a \"dangerous/potentially dangerous domestic animal.\"\n\nThe deputy called me a few hours later to tell me that the dog had, unfortunately, died. He told me that that doesn't change anything in regards to his investigation, but to be aware that the owner could attempt to file for warrants herself or sue me.\n\nTLDR- Got attacked by 2 dogs in my driveway, felt that I was in danger of having my face eaten, shot and killed one of the dogs.\n\nSorry for the long rambling post, but what do I need to do to protect myself here?\n\nThanks", "score": 368, "comments": [{"id": "gcgdsaf", "body": "First and foremost document document document.\nYou said your dog was bitten?

We will have been married 22 years next month. There have been no major issues, although he has been stressed and easy to anger over the last couple of years. He has worked in a high-paying law enforcement job most of our marriage and I have tried to make his home life easy to accommodate for his shift changes, stressful work, etc. That's beside the point. He stated the reason for the separation is because we are on different paths due to opposite interests and he does not see that changing. He said he did not consider divorce because of the kids (16F and 13M) and finances. He literally said he doesn't want to lose half of what he has worked most of his life for - his retirement. The talk yesterday was mostly one-sided because I was stunned. The kids and I have walked on eggshells for years to keep him happy, and this is how I am rewarded. Oh, I also work full-time, but I bring in less than half each month what he does. \nAfter gathering myself over 24 hours, I asked what the goal of separation is if he does not see anything changing with our \"different paths.\" He said he thought I understood the intention is to divorce. But he wants to wait until we pay off a consolidation loan in May. It sounds like his intention is to wait as long as possible to file for divorce. \n\nMy concern and question is: if I let him wait, will he get a more favorable financial settlement regarding his retirement if he retires before the divorce is final? Also, he does not have to retire. He just wants to and is retiring as soon as he can. He plans to get another job, but the job he plans to get will be a contract position - no insurance, not a regular salary.\nI plan to find an attorney to have a consultation ASAP, but I am just hoping to see if I am being too suspicious.

Your husband needs to be aware that these leeches will try to contact him if you pass away owing them money.\n\nYour home is undoubtedly owned as \"joint tenants with right of survivorship\" meaning that the house and mortgage pass directly to your husband on your death.

For both of these policies, the insurer did a full medical exam, including pathology, and reached out to all the doctors I had consulted in the last few years. The personal policy originally had a $750,000 benefit, when I increased the value to $1 million, the insurer redid all the medical work. Life insurance companies generally don't write new policies, or increase the benefit on existing policies, on where the insured life has a serious medical diagnosis. If your husband is the named beneficiary on your life insurance policy, that policy does not become part of your estate - it goes directly to him, no probate, no estate taxes and can't be claimed by creditors. If your policy names \"Estate of... \" as the beneficiary, then it does go through probate and can be claimed by creditors. You can change the beneficiary from \"Estate of...\" to your husband at any time, however, you would normally need your husband's consent to change it from him to \"Estate of...\".\n\nThere are guaranteed issue life companies that write low dollar (\\~$25,000) policies targeted at the elderly.

Since the property line is unclear and, (talking to one of the neighbors) it has never been done before, we hired a licensed surveyor to come out and stake the property. We then requested that the HOA establish the path OFF of our property and onto their common ground (about 10' away) and allow us to put up \"no trespassing\" signs to discourage people from using our property as a conduit to that trail. They agreed and we have done that. Now it seems some of the neighbors have been inflamed, as they have been using that path for many many years, and there is talk of them getting together and asking the county to declare that portion of our property an easement to which they are entitled to continue using.\n\nWhen speaking to one of our more sympathetic neighbors, he told us that the previous homeowner's father was not happy about people walking through the yard either and kept having to chase people off the property. The previous homeowner was Korean and lived here with her Korean parents. I don't think English was their first language, so some of her dad's efforts might have gotten lost in translation. We know less about the homeowner before them, but from what our next door neighbor describes, they didn't know where the property line was or had forgotten about it, and were a lot more comfortable with sharing their personal property with the neighbors anyway. We suspect they were older, better insured, and more financially secure than we are that they did not mind shouldering that kind of risk and burden.\n\nSo my question is, do the neighbors have a legal leg to stand on? Can they have our property declared an easement (it currently isn't one, we've checked), and if so, do we need to legally pursue the previous homeowner for compensation for not disclosing this issue to us during our inspection period?\n\nETA: So this is even more complicated than I first thought. My husband just informed me that the HOA has landscaping on either side of the path (all on our property) that they've been maintaining for many years. In other words, an encroachment. However, they would have had to apply for this and needed to ensure that whatever landscaping they established was not on anyone's property, but on common ground instead. Unfortunately, and we are trying to get the application records from our HOA to confirm, it doesn't appear that they did. Additionally, the previous homeowner that failed to disclose all of this to us is a licensed real estate agent. \n\nETA 2: Since many people have suggested I just put up a fence and be done with it, that would be a goal, but as of now, the HOA covenants do not allow front yard fences. This is part of my frustration because I feel if the previous owners had been able to fence in their front yard, maybe I would never be in this position in the first place. I feel the HOA convenants prevented the previous homeowners reasonable protection from encroachments because they were never allowed to put up a fence, and the first homeowner lived here so long and was so old by the time he left, he forgot where the property line even was. Had he been allowed to put up a fence and define the property, we might have never gotten here in the first place.", "score": 112, "comments": [{"id": "gcex2fg", "body": "If people were cutting across the land for a long time, there might be a \"prescriptive easement.\"  It's sort of like a gentler form of adverse possession.  \n\nYou can talk to a real estate lawyer, but the bar for getting a prescriptive easement is very high in Virginia (i.e., they must have been doing it for 20+ years with the knowledge of the owner).

I was  there for nearly 3 years.\n\nSo that  means I've been applying for jobs. One of the first jobs was a makeup  company who I won't name here - they aren't hugely well known but they  seem quite established.\n\nI got  through to the second stage of the interview - which was designing  infographics for Amazon adverts. I was a bit hesitant about this,  knowing they could very well steal my ideas but thought I was being  paranoid, as quite often in designer roles you're asked to do this. Also  in the brief it specifically said it was just to establish our skill  set.\n\nI looked at their existing  adverts on Amazon and they weren't particularly nice - a green back  ground with kind of pink ink splodge clip art. Their logo is  monochromatic so I thought I'd design the advert in black and white -  with diagonal split screens and close ups of either ends of the  makeupdrush (it was a duet brush so I was doing this to highlight it's  different functions). I even played with placing the photograph of the  brush diagonally to match the split screens. Anyway in the end it looked  really good (Sorry for nerdy rant).\n\nI  sent it off and got invited to the final stage of the interview. Before  I went I noticed the design office was on an industrial estate really  far from where I live - I don't drive so that's an issue. Plus due to  covid, quite a lot of companies are letting people work from home on  some days - but they confirmed to me I'd need to be on site every day. I  also found out that they were offering quite a low wage which was  apparently non negotiable. So in the end I told them it wasn't suitable  for me and that was that.\n\nI have another temp designer job now which suits me far better. But thats irrelevant to this story.\n\nAnyway  this morning curiosity got the better of me and I thought I'd check if  the makeup company had updated their Ads and they have.

This was noted in the offer. They even created a table showing the days I would be working within the year. However, the math in their table resulted in the biweekly and annual salary that matched the offer listed at the top page of my job description.\n\nEssentially, they messed up their math. I did not double check their math. For context, we\u2019re talking a difference of under 10k here but, being a mental health worker that is a significant part of the income I was depending on.\n\nDo I have any legal ground to stand on here? I quit a job I was working and ended an interview process with a different company to take this job. It seems like a breach of contract, right?\n\nI appreciate any advice or help that can be offered.

At-will employment is only a tangentially relevant concept here. A signed offer letter, typically signed by both parties, is still a type of contract. It may not specify the duration of employment (which is where the at-will part comes in), but it is still a formal agreement between the parties. If the employer enticed you to enter employment with them without any intention of honoring the signed agreement, that may constitute fraud.      \n\nHowever, being 'right' often matters a lot less than it should. It's up to you to gauge the nature of your employment and the extent to which you're willing to risk potentially having to find a new job or cope with adverse conditions at your current job as a result of taking action against the company.     \n\nMy advice would to be calmly and clearly show HR or your boss the offer letter and say \"the offer letter states that my salary will be X. based on a recent conversation, I got the impression that my salary may have been lowered. Generally speaking, I think one would normally expect the initial salary to match the offer letter. Can you please explain the discrepancy?\"\n\nIf they are unwilling to work with you, I would suggest *quietly* looking for other jobs.      \n\nThe problem here is with the notion of \"damages\". While there are exceptions, most of the time, your potential recompense is equal to (not just proportional to, but often literally equal to!) the damages you sustained. Right now, they've done something shitty, but you have not yet sustained a significant amount of quantifiable damage from it, from the perspective of the law. Incurring more damage just to have a chance of maybe someday getting a small settlement would be counterproductive. So, practically speaking, you want to minimize damage to yourself, even if it means \"letting them get away with it.\"      \n\nIf this does blow up further and you end up suffering significant harm, such as being unemployed for a long stretch, then it would absolutely make sense to talk to an employment attorney, at least for a free consultation. But again, your goal should be to avoid that situation in the first place. Litigation is unbelievably expensive, and could easily cost more than you'd even be able to win. For something like this, tens of thousands of dollars would probably be the minimum cost for a competent attorney. You don't want to have to deal with any of that, even though you do have the moral and legal high ground.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also file a complaint with the labor relations board, or equivalent. This is free, and will likely be processed very slowly in the background while you move on with your life. But if you do stay, this could also create a awkward situation when it finally does get processed at some point in the future.\n\nIf/when you've found a new job, if you're sufficiently motivated, you could also file in small claims court for the amount missing from your paychecks during the time you were there.", "score": 56}, {"id": "gcsk6et", "body": "If you choose not to keep the job, I think that their changing the salary from what was originally promised has some effect on getting unemployment, but that's all I can think of.

We washed the outer layer). I don't think companies are required to disclose this or put it on tags, but in case it matters, neither of those things happened.\n\nThis morning I woke up suffocating.

Adding onto this that a landlord has to advertise, have potential tenants for viewings, and review their applications? Taking one month to re-rent a unit is not unusual. If you gave your landlord less than 30 days' notice, this makes it even harder.\n* **It is even more difficult to find a new tenant who wants to start a lease mid-month.** You note that you moved out on the 2nd of November. Of all of the apartments I have rented, only a handful have ever begun renting mid-month; everyone else wants to move in on the 1st of the month. Not the 3rd, and not the 15th\u2014the 1st. It may be that they've found a tenant, but one who can't move in until Dec. 1st; this could definitely explain why they didn't mention the unit when you called.\n\nIf this goes on for several months, I might personally consider contacting an attorney.

I wasn't supposed to have access to these documents. Actually they were given to me by my manager because he wasn't doing his job. He was very late on something, which often happens, and asked me to take care of it instead. I did and started suspecting something was wrong as there were fishy discrepancies with invoices. I investigated a little on the side, which I now regret doing. It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer \"for safety reasons\", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.\n\nNow I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything.

The files that I accessed during my \"investigation\" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either.

If you go forward to anybody, they'll probably know it was you since they're already worried enough to fire you.  Maybe they fired you as a threat. (they can't actually come out and say it, right?) If you had kept a copy of any evidence it might be different, but since you haven't, all they'd have to do is get rid of you to tie up loose ends - unless the fraud is super obvious to someone outside the company once they know to look?  Then maybe it's game over for them and they'd not benefit from your death.  \n\n\nI wish I could say, do the right thing, report it, trust the authorities.  But in very few cases does the government actually step in to provide physical protection when required, and it's your neck on the line.  Maybe you can find a safe way to anonymously ask if it's something you could be protected for (not just legally protected, but physically, as in, witness protection).  But without any guarantees the safest thing may be to do nothing.  Maybe move to another country and get a different job - but then again, running scared might tip them off to tie up loose ends.  I could be wrong - maybe they're planning to get rid of you anyway, and going to the police is the safest thing to do so you're not on your own with this - but I don't know if they'd take any physical threats seriously, or be able to do anything about it.  \n\n\nConsider that they may be keeping an eye on you right now - maybe you should log out of reddit and only access this thread from a device outside your home, like a library computer.  \n\n\nYou may want to cover your butt by writing everything down and make sure it's kept somewhere that can't be found.  Or something that's only released in the event of your death, or something - like a letter in your legal will that a lawyer will mail to the news and the IRS and whatever else if you die.\n\n  \nThis completely depends on HOW MUCH money they're making, how big of a company it is, and how big of an operation the fraud is.  If it's big, then they've lasted so long by not leaving anything to chance.  If it's some small business, or one individual making a modest profit in a department of a larger company, then I'm sure there's a lot less to worry about, although I'd still be concerned.    \n\n\nBut you said it was probably large scale, and you seemed to implicate more than one person.  They know you know, or they wouldn't fire you.  They're going to be watching to see if you do anything.  Or maybe they're not going to wait before taking action.  I know you may have friends there involved, but they may not be the ones calling the shots - they may be towing the line to protect themselves.    \n\n\nIf you think there's cause for concern, then think through all angles and maybe have an anonymous talk with the FBI (while keeping the company anonymous, too) before you make a decision, maybe look for more advice online (if you can digitally cover your tracks), stay in safe places, etc.  \n\n\nAnyway, the last thing I'd worry about is getting in legal trouble yourself.", "score": 2}, {"id": "gcn61j2", "body": "His experience explicitly does square with mine.

I have lived in this complex in Cincinnati, Ohio for five years now. Once in a one bedroom apartment, then my boyfriend moved in with me and we transferred to a two bedroom and we just moved into a townhome in May. \n\nWe have had two noise complaints since the beginning of my time here. Both of which were in the two bedroom apartment. Only one was documented and given to us through e-mail. When we lived in the one bedroom we received one notice about or dogs droppings. They claimed we didn\u2019t clean up after our dog out front, which is a lease violation. (This was not true. But we didn\u2019t fight it and let it go) Another time they sent us a lease violation for leaving one bag of trash outside of our door on a rainy day. (We have a trash compactor that is a drive away, so taking it while it\u2019s raining is a bit of a hassle. We didn\u2019t fight this either) All of these incidences were prior to us transferring to the townhome that we live in now. We are in a completely different lease since May. In-between all of the years and the different \u201cincidents\u201d I have frequently butted heads with the property manager. Each time she has flagged us for something is always conveniently when I am trying to get them to do something that needs to be done. (Pressure washing, replacing air filters, etc.) \n\nLast week my boyfriend and I were putting up Christmas decorations at 10:30-12 at night. We received a strange e-mail at eleven at night that I didn\u2019t see until midnight. The property manager emailed me, not even addressing me by name, and stated that they received a report about potential domestic violence from our unit. This, of course, is totally insane. In the email she said she had contacted our local police department to pull any reports that may have been made to them about our specific address, and she also said that they made a report. I called the police department and spoke to several different people, including the officer that was patrolling the area that night. I asked if they had any reports at all about our address, if they had been asked to pull reports about our address and if they had been told to dispatch to our location. (I know with domestic violence that police would be dispatched immediately) All of the people from the department were dumbfounded and confused because they hadn\u2019t been contacted AT ALL. \n\nAfter I found this information I wrote the property manager back. I explained who I spoke to, what they told me, and of course denied domestic violence profusely. (Yes, I was a little rude). The next day I still hadn\u2019t heard back from her. So, I called the office. I spoke to another female that works at the office that is a leasing agent. She said that she had already heard what happened and would have her get back to me. Still didn\u2019t happen. \n\nFinally today she wrote me again and said \u201cWith the history of noise complaints and conferences from the last apartment this a reminder that quiet hours are from 7pm to 11am. If we receive another complaint or police report they will have to give us a 30 days notice to vacate.\u201d \n\nAgain, we have had no noise complaints for this new unit and new lease.

You don't call the police because police look for crimes - maybe they decide you or the child committed one. Most child protection workers are looking to make sure the kid is safe, while also looking at crimes. (If the kid shows up and says they're sexually or physically abusing me, make sure to report that.) If the kid has obvious injuries, especially serious or life threatening, you can and should call for medical assistance.\n\nBut the kid probably just needs a safe place to be for a night. Ask them what's up. See why they can't be home. Maybe their parents don't care, and you're just a place that has food and a clean dry bed without yelling. If at all possible, have another adult at home with you. Good luck.", "score": 2}, {"id": "gcm63nd", "body": "[removed]", "score": 0}, {"id": "gcmam6k", "body": "I live in Canada as well. I am not too familiar with Nova Scotia\u2019s Child Welfare laws, but I did do a bit of research on it. In Canada, abuse is defined as \u201cChild abuse is any form of physical, emotional and/or sexual mistreatment or lack of care that causes injury or emotional damage to a child or youth.\u201d Legally speaking, he is being abused by someone in a position of power. \n\nNova Scotia\u2019s laws are very similar to the rest of Canada. \u201cEveryone has the duty to immediately report to a child welfare agency even a suspicion that a child under 19 may be in need of protective services. Reports may be made anonymously. Once a report is made, child protection social workers assess the information provided to determine an appropriate response\u201d. \n\nNow, the problem with your situation is that you have knowledge of the abuse this child is experiencing. I strongly believe that any child being abused should have CAS involved immediately to asses the risk the child is in. However, some people don\u2019t report these things (some don\u2019t even know they have a legal duty to report), but it is a lot easier to turn a blind eye if you saw it happening on your morning walk through the neighbourhood. You, however, are involved with it. You not only have knowledge of this crime, but you actively helped this child to escape the abuse, even if for one night. While I strongly commend you for helping the child, you have put yourself in a tough spot legally. \n\nIf something absolutely horrible happens to that child at the hands of his parent, say he shows up to school with a big bruise on his eye and a school social worker reports it, CAS will be called, and they may interview the kid. The kid may say \u201coh, well things were bad at home, so I went over to the neighbours house and slept there for a few nights. Then I came back home and mum punched me in the eye\u201d. Chances are, the CAS workers are going to come knocking on your door to see if you know anything. \n\nNow, you could say \u201cwell, Tommy stoped by my house around 1am one night, and asked to stay for two days, so I let him\u201d. Even if you state the facts of the situation, and only the facts, red flags will be raised for you. \u201cWhy did you not question if something was wrong when he showed up at your house so late in the night?\u201d, \u201cdid you not wonder why he asked to sleep at your house when his house is so close by?\u201d, \u201cdid you not notice any fear/anxiety projected from this child when he showed up at your door?\u201d. Eventually, the truth will come out that you have seen this child being hit by his parent on the front lawn, and your failure to report may be held against you (especially if something happened to the child that resulted in death or serious injury). \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that you have reasonable suspicion to believe that this child is being abused, and have witnessed it occurring, and did not comply with your duty to report. \n\nAlone, letting him crash on your couch for a few nights will not get you into legal trouble. But you are now a piece of the puzzle that would need to be put together should something happen to this child, based on the fact that you have witnessed abuse. \n\nThe only way to cover yourself and make sure you\u2019re not a liability is to fulfill your duty to report child abuse. You just need to call the child welfare number, and someone will take down details. These usually include your name, address, name of child, address of child, physical description of child and parent, and why you have reason to believe he is being abused. \n\nNow, from a personal perspective, speaking from my own experience as a 15 year old being abused by my parents, it would\u2019ve meant THE WORLD to me if someone had just picked up the phone and reported my parents. The abuse took a huge toll on my mental health, and it could\u2019ve been stopped if someone had reported  it. I was unable to call myself, because I was worried about the consequences. I needed someone to make that decision to call for me. Because, as children, sometimes we convince ourselves that the abuse \u201cisn\u2019t bad enough\u201d, that we\u2019ll get our parents \u201cin trouble\u201d for reporting it, that our parents will abuse us worse if they find out, that nobody would believe us, or that we\u2019ll be ripped away from our parents and never see them again. There are so many questions a child has, and often, it is debilitating and renders us unable to stand up for ourselves. We need someone to stand up for us. \n\nLegally speaking, you are open to liability should something happen, and reporting it is the only way to cover your butt. But personally speaking, you have the opportunity to help this vulnerable teen get out of a situation which I am positive is taking a huge toll on his mental and physical health. Nothing positive ever comes from abuse, and you may have a chance to make a difference for these children, and aid the CAS in stopping the abuse.\n\nMost likely, they will not be removed from the home. There are some CAS agencies across Canada that are more well-known for using removal from the home as a first line of defence. However, most of them are good about keeping the children in the home, and working with the family to alleviate the situation. That could mean putting all family members in counselling, mandating the parent(s) to attend parent(ing) classes, or simply having a case worker do regular check ins with the family.\n\nHere is a link on the Nova Scotia Canada website with a list of local offices, depending on your district - https://novascotia.ca/coms/department/contact/ChildWelfareServices.html).\n\nI wish you the best of luck :)", "score": 10}, {"id": "gcmc2am", "body": "At this point, you dhould contact the local child service hotline to report possible abuse", "score": 1}, {"id": "gcmdc91", "body": "While being a friend and mentor to the child is supportive and giving him a shoulder to lean on, OP is an adult, not a friend. Adults have a mandatory duty to report child abuse or suspicion of child abuse not only in Nova Scotia, but almost all of Canada and a large portion of the United States.\n\nAt 15 or 16 years of age, most children being abused desperately want the pain they feel from the abuse to stop and want to report the abuse, but they are afraid of the consequences or they are doubting themselves. They could worry about being separately from their siblings, worry they\u2019ll get in trouble for telling on their parents, worry nobody that they are making things up or that nobody will believe them, or worry they\u2019ll end up with nobody to turn to. \n\nLegally speaking, OP is obligated, under the law, to report what they saw because there is reasonable suspicion that this child is being harmed by someone in a position of trust and authority.

This is very untrue and misleading to OP and others who view this comment.\n\nOnly two provinces in Canada (Saskatchewan &amp; Newfoundland and Labrador) will consider someone no longer a child after they turn 16. This doesn\u2019t mean they are an adult, they are still a minor. But they are no longer considered a child by law.\n\nIn every other province and territory in Canada, being considered a legal adult, and having the ability to freely leave home, is dependent on the age of majority (either 18 or 19). Until that minor turns the age of majority, their parents are responsible for their health and wellbeing. The police are also responsible for tracking down and bringing that minor home any time they are reported as running away. In Nova Scotia, police are obligated to search for and return a minor to their parents/guardians up until they turn 19. \n\n&gt; Police will do very, very little if a 16-year-old chooses to leave home and not come back, as long as it is of the kid\u2019s free will.\n\nThis statement is false and, in Canada, there are no circumstances where a police officer would not be legally obligated to get involved if a minor leaves their home, even if it of the child\u2019s free will.

The other weird thing: my husband has supposedly met this man, and he often communicates through my husband e.g. telling me things, bringing up things from my past, etc.  The most recent threat is that he is going to report me to CPS if we end up getting divorced.  The further removed from the situation I get the more I start to think I might just have been victim to some super extreme gaslighting, but he does seem to have information he shouldn't have unless he actually was investigating me...

I'm writing to add something that may be of interest to OP and others. Don't take this as legal advice, because it isn't. I'm only pointing out something a court said. Sorry, but I have to say that.\n\nAfter reading the case cited by the commenter whose username consists of numbers I think the answer is excellent, but a clarification is warranted that could change the answer because the tree in question is dying. The court included a footnote at the very end of the opinion that starts out, \"While not involved in this case, we note that there may be an exception to \\[the rule applied in this case\\] for dangerous dead trees.\" It goes on to cite cases in other States which did make that exception. However, it was not applicable to the particular case in any way, so it was not part of the court's ruling. But that also means there was no reason at all for the court to bring it up and discuss it. It's not something that courts do as a matter of routine. Accordingly, unnecessary digressions like this are widely interpreted as a suggestion to future courts, rather than an idle musing.\n\nIf there were such an exception in Maryland, it would seem to open up the possibility that the neighbor could be held liable for OP's or a third party's damages caused by the tree or parts of it breaking off as a result of its impending demise. No one knows whether that will ever happen, but it might give the neighbors food for thought if OP decided to tell them about it.

Bank is threatening repossession.", "body": "I originally posted this is r/personalfinance and was told to post here.\n\nSo I bought a car for my mom 2 years ago using a loan with my bank. The vehicle is registered under my name only. I am on her insurance policy. She is the primary holder. She got into an accident recently and took the car to the mechanic for repairs. She received the insurance claim check and chose to spend the money on something else instead of getting the car out. I get a call a month later from the bank telling me about the situation (I was unaware of what was going on and assumed everything was being handled). They tell me that the mechanic is processing a lien and its going to get repossessed if I dont work it out with the mechanic. The mechanic is asking for a total of 5,400 which includes 1,950 in storage fees for 30 days. I only have about a fifth of that. Shes only willing to take the 3 grand then the rest in payments and she wants a decision by the 21st. I do not have 3 grand. I tried to apply for many loans and have been denied. Im wondering what my options are at this point. Do I let the bank repossess it? Is the car worth getting out? I still owe 17,000 on the vehicle and I have over 6,000 in credit card debt that I've accumulated this year due to the first covid lockdown. I've heard of surrendering a vehicle but not sure how that would work and I would think I'd still have to pay the mechanic to do that.\n\nI tried to keep this as short and straight to point as possible. If there's any questions I will gladly answer them. Any help is very much appreciated. I am 27 and made the wrong decision by trusting my mom and I dont want to make another bad decision.

She has been making payments on time but even if she couldn't make the payments, I would take care of it because I could afford it. That was my thought process at the time when I bought the car but it never occurred to me that she could pocket insurance money if an accident happened. She had me thinking everything was fine and she was gonna get the car from the mechanic but I had to find out the truth a month later from the bank. \n\n*I dont know why I wasnt contacted by the mechanic or insurance. I dont know why it took a month for the bank to call.\n\n*I spoke to the insurance company to ask why the check wasn't issued out to me or the mechanic and I was told that legally, since my moms the primary holder, she can request the check be sent to her under her name even though its only my name on the registration.\n\n*The mechanic filed the lien about a week ago\n\n*The car is worth 12 - 13k right now\n\n* I am located in California", "score": 29, "comments": [{"id": "ggbull0", "body": "Since everything is in your name, you are the responsible party unfortunately.

Let's try to work through it. \n\nThe mechanic's lien supercedes the bank's lien on the title. If you don't pay the mechanic the mechanic can sell the car (usually the law dictates it must be sold at auction), once the car sells they keep their portion, which by that time will include more storage fees and auction fees. The mechanic must give the rest of the money to your bank. The bank will apply that amount to your loan, and then ask you for the remainder. If you don't have the rest you will need to set up a payment plan with the bank. This way will end up giving the mechanic the most money, and your bank the least. Unfortunately with a car worth more than the mechanic's bill, they don't have a lot of incentive to work with you on their charges. \n\nThat is how everything should proceed if you can't do anything. Here is what I recommend you do. \n\nTalk to the mechanic again. Try to get them to see this as a human/human issue where they can help you out a bit by dropping the storage fees, rather than them looking at it is a profit deal. It is a hassle for your mechanic to store their customer's cars, so I am not saying they are being mean, but maybe you can level with them and get them to budge a little. \n\nThe bank has a vested interest in this deal. If you become insolvent, and you declare bankruptcy, they get nothing. It sounds like things are progressing that direction quickly. See if the bank can get on board with this plan, and if they will, get it in writing. Take a loan from a friend or family member to pay off the mechanic. Immediately sell the car, pay your small loan back and give the rest of the money to the bank. Set up a payment plan with the bank for the remainder, even if it's only $20 per month. \n\nAre you familiar with Dave Ramsey?

Civil suits are the way to recover stolen money.  Depending on the circumstances, you may also be able to sue for the storage costs you incurred.

The tech told us that it has cost approximately $2000 to fix it both times and asked us to try to see who was doing it.

In spite of her doing everything she could to engage with students, their parents, their coaches, and her fellow teachers, she simply could not get a large portion of her online only students to actually attend the zoom classes or turn in any work.  She pretty much removed all deadlines for assignments where she could and even informed the students that as long as they took the midterm exam and passed it then she would give them a passing grade.  However, it has simply been radio silence from the students and many of their parents.\n\nThat said, on Monday she was pulled into a meeting with her administration and told that if she did not \"find a way\" to give these failing students passing grades that she would be reprimanded and forced to sign a \"growth contract\" effectively putting her on a type of probation.  Since that meeting she has been inundated with in-person meetings with and phone calls from the administrative staff saying that they are going to \"help\" by grading some of the midterm exams for her, inspite of her insistence that she be allowed to grade them herself.\n\nNow that brings us to today, when another administrator that she has never worked with before suddenly called her while she was in the middle of a zoom class with students.  He began berating her at a high volume about how it was completely unacceptable that he was being forced to do her work for her and how he was going to ensure that she be punished for \"not doing her job\".  She was obviously very upset and started having a panic attack while still on camera with her students.  She couldn't get herself under control and so she informed the school that she needed to leave immediately for health reasons.  She came home about an hour ago sobbing and it took me a while to get her to calm down.\n\nShe let me know that she has been secretly recording her interactions with the administration, when she could, for a while now (Texas is one party consent).  Apparently, the administration staff have been getting increasingly hostile with the teaching staff in general for a couple of months now.  They have been conducting more and more in-person interactions, presumably, so that they would never have to put anything they said in writing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am not sure if this is relevant, but she did file a complaint about 2 months ago with HR when she discovered that the administration had deliberately lied to her about two separate contacts that she had with covid positive staff.  The official guidance released by the school district stated that anyone in close contact with a covid infected person would mandated a 2 week quarantine.  The administration had told her that the first contacted person was sick with some other than covid and the second person informed her himself that he had had covid upon his return to work.  The school administration had said he was only taking some time off for family matters.  I can understand medical privacy being a concern, but he second person was someone that she works with in her classroom on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, don't know if this is going to get any useful responses.

Once she's actually done that for an individual exam or for a school term, only the school district's board of trustees can authorize a grade change, and then only if they find your wife did not adhere to district grading policy in reaching that final grade.

That's from [Texas Education Code Sec. 28.0216](https://texas.public.law/statutes/tex._educ._code_section_28.0216).

That means they can't force your wife to give students a 50 or 60 (or any minimum) for assignments that aren't done at all, or require her to give all students a minimum passing grade for the semester.
