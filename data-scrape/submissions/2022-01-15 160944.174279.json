You have to time it just right to get your point across as to what the dog is being punished for.  I use one on my SAR K9 to keep him from taking off after animals or heading into a busy street.  I use a tone (a beeping noise) to let him know that he needs to stop or he will get a shock (its a level 1-100 and I keep it around 15/20 just where he can feel it but not hurt).  The whole point of an Ecollar is NOT need to use the shock part.  \n\nNow as a Pit Bull owner, a dog in drive like what the OP states, an Ecollar is just going to provoke the dog.   The breed can feed off of pain (which is why they were great dog fighters) and amp them up.  The worst thing you can do is add pain to a stressful situation like your dog running up to another dog.  I walk my dogs on Prong collars because they are so strong and when loose dogs come up on us I completely relax the dogs leashes so there is no restriction on movement which can make the dogs feel threatened and escalate the problem. \n\nFor the OP, Animal Control needs to be contacted.

The dog had already committed to the attack, and at that point, the shock would have been a slight annoyance if the dog even bothered to acknowledge the stimulation, especially in a pit bull type dog.\n\nTiming is important in these cases. You want to catch the thought, tell the dog no that thought is bad, and not wait until you get the behavior. If you wait until you have a behavior you don't want, you're already far too late.\n\nAppropriate shock collar training is about teaching the dog what you want the shock to mean: refocus on me, the handler/owner, I want to have a conversation with you. Some people choose to apply shock as in no, behavior bad, which is not as effective, and follows more along the lines of invisible fence methodology.\n\nInvisible fences apply shock in a very different method of thought. Appropriate shock collar usage is as stated above, having a conversation with your dog, hey I don't like that thought you're having, followed by a redirection or other training command to get the dog on a better behavioral path. The point of an invisible fence is not conversation, it's LEAVING YARD BAD, and so the shock is applied at a much higher level straight away and this is why they can be successful.

Verbal agreements are worth nothing when the trust must be administered--the language of the trust must be strictly followed.\n\nDoes the company have a person in charge who is running/managing things or is that you?

Someone in the accounting department should be preparing monthly income statements that would show how much per month the business is making in net income/profit (the money that is left over after expenses have been paid).  Is there enough business cash available for someone to start paying off the credit card debt and the accounts payable?  The $160K in accounts receivable is far too high, but certainly understandable.  It means that the company has been too trusting of its customers to let them go too long without paying their bills on time--you can correct that situation by having someone in the A/R department to start aggressively making collection calls to ask for your money or by hiring a debt collection company to do the same thing, and if they are successful in collecting this could be a good source of future income for this company.

I moved in maybe four or five months ago (time has lost all meaning during lockdown) to a new building. The day I moved in, I met a seemingly-nice old lady. \n\nShe helped me out one day when I was locked out of my apartment, and I left a thank you note and a small candy gift outside her door. Everything was polite and nice. \n\nBut then she started asking favors of me, scaling it up from one quick errand to a significant amount of chores, shopping, cleaning, etc. I told her I was on disability for a reason -- I have both physical and mental health disabilities -- and she made some rude comments insinuating I was lying about my depression.\n\nShe also started to try to sell me on her religion. She wanted to \"lay hands on\" me to \"heal [my] migraines\" and implied it would heal my depression as well. I politely declined and she asked about my family's religion. When I told her what it was and it was different than hers, she made faces and a few disparaging remarks, and ever since then has been trying in earnest to convert me, telling me my family's religion is fake and sinful and we're all going to hell and that my late grandparents are in hell.\n\nBy this time I'd known her for about a week, and she started saying \"I love you\" to me. Repeatedly. And I knew it was time to cut contact.\n\nIt was then that I started trying to distance myself from this woman. I asked her several times specifically *not* to get things for me at the store, but she would come to my door and hover outside it for minutes at a time, listening through the door -- sometimes while I was on zoom doing my therapy sessions, other times right around midnight -- and when I'd open the door to tell her to go away she'd act like she'd just gotten there and I hadn't heard her squeaky walker and shuffling feet come up the hallway ten minutes earlier and stop right outside my door. Then she'd give me things I'd asked her not to buy me.\n\nI stopped reciprocating with thank-you notes and return gifts when she gets me things I have asked her not to get me. I blocked her number and deleted the increasingly passive-aggressive voicemails because they made me uncomfortable (and were also filling up my mailbox). If I saw her in the laundry room and she hadn't spotted me, I'd leave as quickly as I could.\n\nBut sometimes she does spot me, and on several occasions she has blocked my exit from the laundry room or blocked me from going up the stairs to get away from her and gotten right up in my face. It's like a switch has been flipped. She's passive aggressive, she's outright aggressive. This little old lady scares me.\n\nAnd every time she corners me in the hallway, she starts calling me incessantly again. \n\nIt's been four or five months now. I blocked her number about two weeks into all this. Three weeks ago, I sent her a text asking her to not contact me again (she told me she texts her grandchildren and whatnot so I know she got it, she just didn't reply). Today I left a letter on her door. It was not rude, I did not insult her -- it just said something like \"hello, I have asked you multiple times not to contact me. Please stop calling my voicemail, coming to my door, leaving me things, etc. I want no further contact, not even for you to come to see me about this note.\"\n\nThen a little while later I came out of the elevator and bam, there she was. I tried ignoring her but she started following me. I asked her to leave me alone multiple times, but she kept saying, \"no, no,\" and I kept repeating myself: leave me alone. She started giggling madly then, and said in a sing-song, admonishing voice, \"you're *grumpy.*\" I told her I wasn't grumpy and that I wanted to be left alone. She said no over and over again and I tried to leave through the front door when she reached out to grab my arm to stop me.\n\nThat really scared me, as I grew up in an abusive household, and so before I even realized it I had yelled \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" That yell was enough to freeze her for just an instant, and I slipped out the door and out of the building. She yelled after me, \"*I'm going to report you!*\"\n\n**#TL;DR:**\n\nNeighbor lady was friendly at first, then scary. Blocks my exit and gets into my personal space. Does not listen when I have asked her not to contact me. Is now threatening to report me because I yelled at her to leave me alone when she was trying to grab me while I was trying to get away from her. \n\nHow do I go about getting a restraining order when our interactions have been in person ever since I blocked her number?

Upon being investigated, the manager of this program launched a counter-investigation against me, claiming I had been acting \"creepy and weird\" with the client for whom I am advocating. She made multiple false claims about me, and then told the investigator she shouldnt have said what she said, but it was too late because you can't just make a claim like that and then take it back. Luckily the majority of the people the investigator called backed me up, telling him I was a dedicated employee and that they were pretty sure I wouldnt do that. It came back as being an unfounded claim (thank god) but this is insane. What should I do?? It seems wrong to let this get swept under the rug, but I never wanted this situation to turn like this.

This is not our primary residence; however, once the rehab is done, we intend to move in and make it our primary residence.  We have a mortgage on the place to pay for the rehab, so it's gone through an exhaustive title search.  (With this mortgage and a grant program, there are liens on this house that approximately equal or are greater than its value in its present condition.)  In its current condition, it is not livable- there is no running water, no walls, no flooring, no ceilings.\n\nThis neighborhood is gentrifying and as a result investors really want properties there.  We've had literally hundreds of people call asking to buy the place... we've had lots of complaints to city code enforcement in the hopes that we'd get tired of them and unload the place.\n\nOn Friday, my contractor called me and said that some guy dropped off a weird letter to one of his guys who was working on the place.  He asked me if I knew what was going on, and I had no idea.  The letter is handwritten and it reads:\n\n&gt;July 17, 2020  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NOTIFICATION OF EVICTION  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To whom it may concern:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On this seventeenth day of July 2020, all tenants, occupiers, occupants, residents, dwellers, lessees, and renters are provided a 10-day notice of eviction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The premises must be vacated by August 3, 2020 or further legal action may follow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This property has been claimed by Mr. A--- F--- who can be reached at (---) --------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Candidly,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A---- F----\n\nThe actual property address is not on the letter.  I really didn't think anything of this- I thought it was a prank or scare tactic or something.  But then the guy came back, walked around the inside, and *stole the key to the house*.  Unfortunately due to Covid, the police department in this city is not doing any in-person contact except for immediate emergencies.  They directed me to leave my number on a voicemail and an officer would get back to me.  I haven't heard anything yet.  I have changed the locks on the front door, but the side door is still accessible by removing a piece of wood that covers the doorway.\n\nI'm utterly confounded about this.  I triple checked the county auditor (property is still in our name), county recorder (no new liens have been recorded), all local and regional court sites- no pending lawsuits against us that I can see.  The legal requirement for squatter's rights in Ohio is inhabiting and improving and abandoned property for 21 years.  As far as I can see this guy has no legal right to our property whatsoever.  Unless somebody many years ago did a \"deed in a drawer\" trick and never had ownership transferred.  But why does this guy even think he can do this??\n\nIs this a case where he can hire an attorney to make our life hell, and then say, \"Hey you know this is going to cost you $50k to litigate but I'll be happy to settle for $5k\" deals?  Or is this such a clearly cut-and-dry case that a judge would grant a motion to dismiss?  Do I need to keep stalking the website of the Eviction Court in this city to make sure he's not trying to do something stupid like sue the house itself or serve papers to a place that is clearly uninhabited?\n\nWhat I'm more worried about is that he'll try to take the property by force.  If I'm working there (or if my contractor is working there), this guy can show up, call the cops, and claim that I am trespassing on his property- then the cops would force me to leave.  That would be annoying if it happened once, but he could do this repeatedly until I was able to establish with the police that he is not the owner- and that might take a court appearance.", "score": 256, "comments": [{"id": "fyihsol", "body": "My guess is this is some sort of Sovereign Citizen craziness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It sounds like the (Ohio 314) individuals may have  been engaging in Sovereign Citizen 'squatting.'

We are both ambitious people and made the most of our professional development in college by attending company events, conferences etc. At a conference, Sarah met someone that would enter our lives as her mentor, and later would be somewhat of a mentor to me by association. I'll call this mentor Bobby (Male 57 year old). Bobby calls himself a christian man and is very involved in church with his wife as relationship counselors for newly engaged couples. He is also very successful in his career, sits on millions of dollars and has a lot of connections at big companies. Sarah is very strong in her faith and saw Bobby as a great mentor for her spiritually and in her professional development. They began meeting for lunch and discussing personal growth and overall life goals. Before long, Bobby had gained Sarah and I's trust. He was becoming a mentor to me (when I was around Sarah) but never reached out to me like he did with her. We would come to him with relationship advice and trusted his guidance as a counselor, even though he would favor Sarah's side even when she knew she was wrong.\n\nFast forward to us graduating college and starting our careers. Sarah gained gained absolute trust in Bobby and began to see him as a father. Hell, I even looked up to the guy. We were looking somewhere to live in a metro area to be close to work. Bobby lives in a more suburban area away from the metro area, but this didn't stop him from suggesting that we look for apartments in the town he lives. After looking, Sarah decided her favorite apartment was one which was around a mile away from Bobby and his wife's house. I told her that the location was much further away from the metro area, and that it would be mildly inappropriate to move so close to this guy that takes an unusual and eccentric interest in her professional development. After not coming to agreement of a better place to live, Bobby invited her to come sign the lease, and spent 45 minutes on the phone manipulating her into thinking that this was a choice she should make on her own and independent of me. He also suggested she sign the lease and tell me after.\n\nI lost a lot of trust because of this and told her that he was manipulating her, and wanted her close to him. I also thought the situation was getting creepy, and that he had surpassed me in Sarah's loyalty. I talked to Sarah about this and told her that I'd move in, but we need to limit contact with Bobby because he influences her to do things which are not good for our relationship. She agreed. With all the trust I lost over the signing of the lease, I became hypersensitive to what Sarah was doing and was monitoring her, catching her in little white lies left and right. We constantly fought about my loss of trust in her, and with no where to turn we phoned Bobby, who again took her side. He called me and had a one on one after our joint call, and told me that I needed to work on trust. At this point he would come over when I was not there, and help Sarah set up investment accounts. He would invite Sarah to run in the mornings without me knowing the next few days after my one on one phone call, and would say that I am not the right guy for her and that I may be the devil (lol).\n\nA couple of days later, he invited Sarah over to have a one on one with him in person. He said that I can't know about it, and that she needed to hide it. When she arrived he had wine ready out back for them to have their talk. He began saying that Im not the guy Sarah should marry, and that I'm not good for her. He mentioned that he normally mentors people in a few areas, and that sexuality was one of them. He said he and Sarah hadn't touched that topic. He then began asking about sex and pushed for details. Bobby insisted that Sarah didn't know what it was like to be pleasured. He suggested that she needed to leave me and masterbate in a special way to release the pain of breaking up with me. Sarah was starting to feel weirded out, but followed him in the house when he said they needed to talk inside and that he would \"talk her through what he meant\". She asked why they couldn't stay outside, but he insisted, stating that \"nothing would happen in there, don't worry\". She reluctantly followed and sat down on a couch in his basement. He placed himself right next to her almost touching her. She began to cry about our relationship and said that she needed to pray. He placed his hand on her knee and held her hand- I had seen him do this before in a father-daughter fashion when she was distraught. She didn't think much of it until he reached up her dress and tugged on her spandex. She pulled away and he noted that everything was okay and that she didn't need to worry. She continued crying on the topic about us when she suggested maybe she should meditate about it. \"Yes lets meditate!\" exclaimed Bob. He forcefully tugged her in and began to kiss her head, cheeks, forehead and then began to position her head as he went in for the lips. Sarah freaked out and said it was getting late and rushed up the stairs and out the door. \"Well, goodnight then\" mumbled bob as she made her way out.\n\nSarah admits Bobby had groomed her and had an agenda the whole time. He was responsible for 90% of the pain points in our relationship, including the problems she felt the need to go to him to. We believe he engineered these predatory moves to groom, gain trust, and isolate her from me.\n\nNote; This man has been married since college, he is 57. His wife was not in town the night of the incident. Sarah told me what happened a day later and that he was out of our life for good. We also payed the penalty to break our lease to move somewhere else.\n\nWith Bobby's status, wealth, and connections to our employers, we are scared to file a police report for sexual assault. We are also hesitant to even call his wife and tell her.

Is that not a tough bar to climb with a well educated and and well employed girl? \n\nNot necessarily. Witness credibility is tested across many spectrums. Regardless of your intelligence and your employment, there are still commonalities among all people that affect credibility. Look at witness credibility experiments. Even on a general scale, there are always two sides of a story. Your perception of events aren't going to be exactly the same as another persons. \n\nThat's going to ring especially true for a case where you're getting down to splitting hairs on technicalities like in this instance. That's one of the reasons why I'm saying this case is hard to prosecute. You weren't there you don't know exactly what was said or what non verbal communication was made. \n\nConsent is a spectrum. While verbal communication of your intent to have or not have sexual contact with someone is ideal that's generally not how it goes down in practice.That's kind of a mood killer to get that rigid with someone. When you're trying to be romantic or even seductive, it's usually a combination of indirect conversations and non verbal cues that lead from point A (the \"talk\") to point B (the \"foreplay\") to point C (the \"intercourse\"). \n\nAgain, you don't know what was said or done in this meeting. You're only getting a retelling from one side *after* the situation became stressful. Your girlfriend could very well have forgotten or blocked out a series of sentences she said and nonverbal gestures she made that may lead a juror to believe that she could have been consenting to the amount of touching that occurred.\n\nHe may have a better memory on the subject because he wasn't stressed out by the situation as it was occurring. He may be able to remember what exactly she did that led him to believe it was okay to touch her. The lawyer he hires may be able to use that memory to elicit testimony from her that jogs her memory and she confirms that she indeed did do those things.\n\nBecause nothing really progressed further we're only talking about consent from going to point A (the \"talk\") to trying to get to point B (the \"foreplay\") here, not even getting to Point B, much less Point C. So, it's not going to have to be much in way of communication. It's doubtful you're going to get a jury to think that in order for him to have consent to kiss her on the forehead and to touch her thigh and she had to have explicitly said, \"You may kiss me on the forehead and you may touch me on the thigh.\" It could only take a flirty sentence or two. Some friendly body gestures of her touching him first. Some juror may think these actions are so harmless that consent to them are really irrelevant in the first place. It's all situational, I can't give you a concrete answer but I can tell you that the entire conversation they had and every single action BOTH of them took that night will be dissected down to each base movement and thought. \n\n&gt;The only thing i can think a defense lawyer could do is bring forth our relationship problems of my lack of trust in her, but i don't think any texts exist about it. If there were texts, could the prosecutor object because the texts, and even subject matter, do not involve the charges?\n\nThe prosecutor likely isn't going to care. They don't represent the victim. They represent the state. The prosecutor has a duty to turn over any exculpatory evidence they collect. So, if they take your girlfriend's phone and collect *all* text messages on it, and those text messages somehow can mount a defense, they *must* turn them over. If they don't get them, they don't have to. \n\nBut that doesn't mean the *defense* can't get them. If your girlfriend doesn't want to turn them over, she would have to hire a private attorney to quash the subpoena, which would be unlikely to happen if there's even a shred of probative value to them. Here, I would think a judge would think text messages regarding trust issues with your girlfriend probative if those trust issues stem from your girlfriend's odd relationship with this man and the defense could tie it into a fidelity issue, which does go to the heart of the charges.", "score": 6}, {"id": "fy48kir", "body": "[removed]", "score": 0}, {"id": "fy4jow2", "body": "**No Clear Legal Question**\n\nYour post does not appear to contain a legal question - or if it does, it\u2019s not clear what it is.

First, a quick synopsis: My partner passed away in early 2017 after a lengthy struggle with mental illness.\nHer brother, despite not having any real contact with her during the last 7 years of her life (by her choice, not his) was present at her final moments with myself as I figured at her death bed wasn't the time to perpetuate long standing grudges and despite their issues he deserved to be there with her at the end.\n\nAfter she passed, we discussed the future and, after a discussion between the two of us, he elected to start a gofundme in her name under the pretense of raising money for the immediate assistance of myself and the our two young children that she left behind.\n\nAlthough I personally find the concept of cash for condolences to be a bit tacky and found it odd that he'd want to start immediately banging around the donation tin, I acquiesced and let him create the fund.\n\nDuring the campaign, he raised around 9 or so thousand from friends and family, as well as pocketing cash handed to him at the funeral itself (her hometown has a large Italian population and apparently that is the norm?) and from selling her vehicle, despite promising not to do so without discussion with me as he had no legal right to do so and I was her only stated next of Kin.\n\nOnce the campaign had concluded, he and I entered into discussion as to how the Money would be Used, at which point he decided that, despite previous agreements and what he had initially stated on the gofundme, that he was now going to awkwardly insert himself into our fiscal matters and put the money into a fund for the children to access when they turn 18. He then amended the gofundme page from the original intention to reflect this change, which understandably upset some of those who donated thinking it would go to help the family during the time of struggle rather than go towards some arbitrary fund for the future. \n\nDespite ostensibly being to immediately assist us with the funeral costs and the like, I agreed to the creation of a fund on the sole condition that, if he insisted on retaining some element of control regarding the fund, then we BOTH get established as signatories, so to alleviate whatever concerns he had that I wouldn't use the money in a matter that he didn't agree with and, conversely, he wouldn't be able to do the same, as both of us would need to sign for anything.\n\nHe refused to give me any signatory power, despite me pointing out that by doing so would protect the fund from anyone being able to just dip in at their convenience, and after lengthy arguments it became clear that he never had any real intention of even creating the fund, despite his claims. \n\nHe demanded to be the sole person in charge, despite having nothing to do with either myself or my children's lives up to this point, and the entire thing felt disingenuous and a way for him to try and retain power, as I couldn't see why, for both of our peace of mind, he wouldn't have myself, the children's only surviving guardian, involved in their fiscal fund at all, unless he intended to use the money for purposes other than what he was stating.\n\nLong story short, I told the cockwomble to jog on and messaged those people that I could who had donated to pull their money out while they could and to keep it for themselves, of which about 3000 was removed from the gofundme in response.\n\nHowever, with the 5000 or so left, he, promising to create a trust fund, absconded with the money and, to this day has never created any fund, particularly as he has no legal right to and doesn't even know my the dates of birth or full names of either of my children. He also, as mentioned above, sold my partners car without my permission and kept the money, despite me possessing the only title of ownership for said vehicle.\n\nDisgusted, I pursued what legal avenues were available to me, but after reporting the case to the gofundme campaign to ACORN, the Australian cybercrimes division, I, after nearly a year and a half, have received notice that the acts he committed by obtaining funds through deceptive measures, somehow doesn't constitute fraud as clear intent can't be established.\n\nIn regards to the stolen car being sold off, I reported this to local authorities and was told that, as the property was considered part of a deceased estate, my only recourse was to pursue the matter in civil court as it didn't constitute a criminal offence, despite the fact that this fucking jizz stain literally stole the vehicle and sold it for his own profit.\n\nI don't profess to know all of the intricacies of the law, indeed it's extremely convoluted, but in my eyes both acts are clearly cases of theft and profiting due to deception and fraudulent means, yet I'm basically told to eat shit and smile while I'm doing so by any law enforcement agency I've reported it to.\n\nSo, I'm curious if there is anything at all I can do or if I have been misinformed in some manner, as I frequently see people getting caught running gofundme scams yet this douchenozzle has got away with it seemingly scot free.\n\nI don't care about the money at all, but I do care about justice and feel that it hasn't been served here; basically, from what I've been told, you can create fake gofundme campaigns and sell a deceased person's property out from under their surviving next of kin without any legal ramifications, which just doesn't sound right by any conception.\n\nSo, do I have any alternate avenues in which I can approach this situation? It's been going on 3 and a half years now and I just feel that  the legal system has let myself and my children down whilst literally rewarding the perpetrator with funds acquired under false pretense and off of selling stolen property.\n\nApologies for the extremely long post; I'm located in Australia, if that affects anything.\n\nCheers.", "score": 92, "comments": [{"id": "fy3cqxw", "body": "The majority of the people on this sub are not from Australia, so they might not know Australia law.

So now they are helping me to dispute the charge, and told me that hopefully it will be resolved soon based off the information from the case, and told me to call them back and let them know if the store decides to issue a refund after all.\n\nI have never had to dispute a charge before, and have never been in a situation like this, so I am not sure if there is anything else I should do. I'm trying to take the right steps to make sure that I get a full refund for all the furniture I never received, but I worry that the furniture store will not want to comply or will make things difficult in some way. Is there anything else I should do or be aware of?  \n\n\nEdit to add where I am because a nice bot requested it - I'm in Florida.

The important bit . . .\n\n&gt; A person commits the crime of first degree criminal trespass if such person knowingly and unlawfully enters or remains in a dwelling of another or if such person enters any motor vehicle **with intent to commit a crime therein.**\n\n(Sidenote, in my opinion it is a poorly written statute, because the \"with intent to\" phrase applies to both scenarios (dwelling or vehicle) but isn't punctuated correctly.)\n\nIn your news article, the landlord seemingly had the intent to commit the crime of ~~being a super creep~~ misdemeanor obscenity, apparently.  That is what makes this criminal trespass, not the fact that he entered - even if it violated the terms of the lease.\n\nAs expected, [Louisiana's criminal trespass statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2018/code-revisedstatutes/title-14/rs-14-63/) is completely different.\n\nMoreover, the parent comment here is just patently bad.

His doctors recommended physical therapy, and the day he was discharged from the hospital I, my sister, and my mother drove him to the physical therapy/nursing home in our car (my mom couldn't afford to pay for the ambulance.) \n\nHere's where the problems start: The admissions manager at the nursing home told my mom they have strict COVID regulations in place to prevent their patients catching it (specifically every patient only works with one nurse) and all patients are placed under quarantine for 2 weeks. Once out of their quarantine the patients would have to be socially distanced, and in their rooms unless in specific communal areas. They told my mom that they hadn't had any COVID cases yet because of these safety regulations, and because they test all of their staff weekly. That all sounded great. But when we arrived we found out that this wasn't the case, and admissions was extremely unprofessional.\n\nWhen we arrived the receptionist told us she was very new. We weren't greeted by any administrators or supervisors. There were nurses walking around the ground floor but they were ignoring us and going home. The receptionist looked up my dad's room, led me and him to an elevator and told us to go up to the ward upstairs. My mom and sister would follow me in the next elevator. I got upstairs with my dad, who by that point wasn't talking much, and walked out of the elevator into the ward. There were patients in wheelchairs, some with masks on, some without, all over the place. There were nurses milling around who didn't even acknowledge that I was there. No one noticed us until my mom and sister came upstairs, at which point they started to yell at us. Apparently the receptionist had allowed us into a closed ward that only patients and nurses are allowed in. They took my dad's belongings, told us a nurse would take care of him, and told us that we had to go back downstairs without him. We did not get a proper chance to say goodbye. \n\nWhen we got downstairs we were told to wait until the night supervisor could meet with us. This was several minutes. During this time another nurse came over to us and said \"I'm sorry, I know this is hard, I wouldn't want to do this with my grandpa either.\" We pointed out that this wasn't my grandpa, this is my dad. We were furious. The night supervisor shows up dripping sweat. She introduces herself,  and explains we weren't supposed to be allowed upstairs but that they'll \"forgive it this time.\" My mom tells her my dad has his medications in his belongings, and that the admissions person said that was fine. The supervisor freaks out, says patients are only allowed to have meds from the pharmacy on site, and runs upstairs to get them. She come's back and we ask her questions about their COVID policies (one nurse to each patient). She looks at us like we're insane and says they only do that for COVID positive people, and asks if my dad is COVID positive. We said no. I asked who the day supervisor would be and she didn't know. She just told us which room my dad would be in, and that he was being helped by a nurse. Overwhelmingly, it was a negative first experience and we were considering bringing him home first thing in the morning. I left thinking they might've lied to my mom about having no COVID patients as well, based on their reaction to our questions.\n\nWhat I need legal advice on: This morning my mom gets a phone call from the nursing home that my dad fell out of bed and landed on his left side (the paralyzed side) and that he is being rushed to the ER in an ambulance. They don't know if he hurt his arm because he can't feel it, or if he hit his head again. There were no railings on the sides of the bed, or anything in place to keep him from falling. We don't know what time he fell, how long he was on the floor before someone noticed him, and if we're going to have to pay for this ambulance now. We don't know who will be responsible for my father's medical expenses if he was injured in this fall. The behavior of the staff was very unprofessional, and I'm concerned there was negligence involved. My dad is in the ER right now, and we don't know his status. I don't know what to do and really need advice.

If the neighbor had, say, a basketball hoop in her yard, and the wind blew the hoop over, it\u2019s leaning against the fence, and it\u2019s now hanging over the fence and extending into OP\u2019s yard. We wouldn\u2019t dispute that the basketball hoop still belongs to OP\u2019s neighbor even though it\u2019s hanging over OP\u2019s property. So too with the pumpkin. \n\nIf you go onto someone else\u2019s land, or cause another person or thing to go on someone else\u2019s land, that is trespass. You can check the Restatement of Torts. So the pumpkin plant, the property of OP\u2019s neighbor, has entered onto OP\u2019s land. That is trespass. \n\nOP\u2019s remedy is to ask the neighbor to remove the pumpkin, and if the neighbor fails to, then OP could remove it. OP would be on safer ground to do this with a court order, but that\u2019s not likely to be cost effective in this scenario. \n\nThis is the same scenario as when a tree branch grows out over a neighbors yard and then the other neighbor saws the branch off and there\u2019s a dispute or something. The pumpkin does NOT belong to OP.", "score": 61}, {"id": "fz7o7bx", "body": "Yo, folks.\n\nThis post is a prime example of why we ask that users actually know and understand relevant laws before commenting, and [for the love of all that is good in the world, read the subreddit rules before commenting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index#wiki_general_rules) \n\nPeople are getting the difference between \"is allowed to trim vegetation over a property line\" and \"who owns said overgrowing vegetation\" confused, and to the result of there being a LOT of bad answers, as well as a crapton of unhelpful and sarcastic ones. \n\nHints: being allowed to trim vegetation doesn't mean it's your vegetation.

If the arrears get bad enough, the HOA will almost certainly foreclose.\n\nSeparately, I can't see what refusing to pay will accomplish. If your HOA is $250,000 in debt, they have to pay that debt, and an HOA only has one source of revenue to pay it from. It's reasonably possible that raising the dues now will make it cheaper in the long run, as paying it down faster will limit the interest that can accrue.\n\nI applaud your efforts to oust the board over this, as it clearly wasn't a good decision to get into an expensive legal battle over a 1A issue.

Typically if the dues are raised more than 20%, or the special assessment is more than 5% a membership vote is required. But if this settlement was the result of a court order they generally don't need a membership vote, and they could do a special assessment over a set period of time. If this process was not followed correctly it may be possible to overturn it, but if the association still owed the money it is going to come from the members one way or another.\n\nIf you don't think the board is doing a good job you can recall and replace them. There are a lot of new requirements as of this year for elections. The short of it is you need at least 5% of member signatures to start, to schedule the election at least 30 days out and to send out ballots(which means you need to find enough people who are interested in running). You need to get enough people to vote to have quorum, to have a majority of votes to replace the board. So you probably need to call people and knock on doors and remind people to vote and ask to collect proxies. You need an independent inspector for the election, not the current management company. \n\nCA law only allows for banning signs if they are very large, over 9sq ft for signs and posters and 15 sq ft for flags, or are somehow permanently incorporated into the building like painted on and covered by architectural rules. Lawyers pursuing this should have let the HOA know before pursing any real legal action. Typically the damages would not be anything near $250k, it sounds like there were punitive damages involved. If a board member violated their fiduciary duty it is possible they could be personally liable, and their homeowners liability insurance could cover some of or all of this, or that the HOA could recover some or all of this debt from the homeowner.

(but falling short of willful neglect of HIPAA Rules)\n* **Tier 3:** A violation suffered as a direct result of \u201cwillful neglect\u201d of HIPAA Rules, in cases where an attempt has been made to correct the violation\n* **Tier 4:** A violation of HIPAA Rules constituting willful neglect, where no attempt has been made to correct the violation\n\n### HIPAA Violation Penalty Structure\n\n* **Tier 1:** Minimum fine of $100 per violation up to $50,000\n* **Tier 2:** Minimum fine of $1,000 per violation up to $50,000\n* **Tier 3:** Minimum fine of $10,000 per violation up to $50,000\n* **Tier 4:** Minimum fine of $50,000 per violation\n\nAlso,   \n\nWhile HIPAA does not have a private cause of action, it is possible for patients to take legal action against healthcare providers and obtain damages for violations of state laws.\n\nIn some states, it is possible to file a lawsuit against a HIPAA covered entity on the grounds of negligence or for a breach of an implied contract, such as if a covered entity has failed to protect medical records. In such cases, it will be necessary to prove that damage or harm has been caused as a result of negligence or the theft of unsecured personal information.\n\nFiling Complaints for HIPAA Violations\n\nIf HIPAA Rules are believed to have been violated, patients can file complaints with the federal government and in most cases complaints are investigated.

He says that while flying above my house he believed that the system securing his camera might have come loose. He didn't want to fly it back to him in case the camera fell in flight, so he immediately landed it in place. That place happened to be my back yard, where my dog was outside in the yard (my husband was outside with her, but was underneath his project car doing work on it and did not notice the drone landing). From the video he showed, it appears she picked it up and carried it to the top of her dog house (she likes to lay on top) but since the dog house is slightly sloped, it just fell right off, falling several feet onto the concrete. She got down, carried it up again, it fell off again. She is not very smart and it took her 5 times before she gave up and left it on the ground. She was not chewing on it or anything during this time - she was just plain picking it up and then setting it down on a sloped surface. Again, not smart. But not dangerous.\n\nBy this time the drone's owner had walked over and was extremely upset.  He called our dog \"vicious\" which she is not. He  apparently calmed down and asked my husband if he would pay his insurance deductible to repair or replace it. My husband said no, it's not like our dog went to this guy's house and stole his drone and ruined it, he literally landed it on the ground 10 feet from her. The guy left upset.\n\nHe came back last night and said that he attempted to file with his business insurance, but they won't cover it, and instead asked if we would file a claim on our homeowner's insurance. My husband said no (we are actually 100% sure but he did not want to commit to anything on a whim). He then went out to his car, but came back a few minutes later and asked if we would file with our insurance if he pays the deductible. My husband again said no.\n\nThis morning he left a letter in our mailbox stating that he will give us until 7PM on Sunday to reach out to come to an agreement to deal with the damages, or on Monday morning he will file a police report and make a claim in small claims court.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about filing with our homeowner's insurance because \"dog damaged property\" has a pretty nasty ring to it.  Thanks to the fact that the drone was literally carrying a camera we know our dog wasn't chewing on it or anything, but I don't want a record on our homeowner's insurance that implies we have a dangerous dog - hell maybe by insurance standards she IS dangerous for this, but I'm very leery of it.\n\nObviously I understand that if our dog bites someone on our property that is a problem and we are liable - but is there anything legal that dictates fault if someone lands a drone on our property?

Roommate has taken advantage of the legal situation and left the apartment without finding a replacement, leaving us to compensate for his rent.\n\nIn March 2019, my two roommates (A and B) and I signed a lease renewal for our 3BR apartment. A and B joined mid-lease 2019, and were only occupants at this time, not leaseholders. I was the only leaseholder at this time because I was there during the signing of the original lease in 2018. Both roommates were aligned with the lease renewal and expressed long term interest in the apartment. This was right before the virus began to gain speed.\n\nWe wanted to add them as leaseholders before signing the renewal but could not, as the office said that the previous roommates had to be removed from the lease, before adding A and B. After accepting this, I signed and we left that meeting, and contacted my previous roommates. We learned the previous roommates had submitted their lease removal forms last year and it was already processed. I was already the only leaseholder during the time of this signing, and we could have added A and B during the resigning meeting.\n\nTo formalize A and B as leaseholders, we prepared the necessary forms ASAP. However, the office was already closed and we could not submit the forms in-person. We called the office and were instructed to send the representative the forms via email instead. We emailed the forms to the office on the same day. We followed up multiple times with no confirmation that A and B were added to the lease.\n\nWe would not have signed the lease renewal, if we knew that A and B would not be added to the lease. It's a professional courtesy and expectation of the leasing office to acknowledge our application -- either by accepting, or explaining what was missing, which we were willing to immediately address.\n\nBecause B was not added to the lease, he has now taken advantage of the situation. He moved out of the apartment last week without any contractual obligation to pay, and we are forced to compensate for his rent. His room was around 40% of the total rent, and A and I must now pay that, in addition to our current rent. We cannot find a replacement roommate in the current environment, even when offering discounted rates. B refuses to help pay for any months until a replacement is found, or any early lease termination fee, because he was not formally on the lease.\n\nNow that we are working remote, A and I are both living at our parents houses. We don't necessarily need the apartment for the foreseeable future, so we are *okay* with a full lease termination.\n\nI asked about lease termination options in June when B first told us his move out plans, and learned I am expected to pay 3 months worth of rent ($12k+ between A and myself) to terminate the lease. This is unreasonable because of the steps my roommates and I took to explicitly avoid this situation.\n\nI sent an email explaining the situation to the leasing office and the representative two days ago after realizing that we had evidence of their negligence, but they haven't responded.\n\nI've laid out what seems to be the available options.\n\n* Option 1: Leasing office recognizes their fault and gives us some compensation in the form of early lease termination with waived fee, or rent reduction to exclude the third room.\n* Option 2: There is some sort of legal action we can take to be compensated for the leasing office's mistakes\n* Option 3: A and I terminate the lease by the office's terms by paying 3 months worth of rent\n* Option 4: A and I keep paying inflated rent and looking for a replacement. This is the least desirable route because we don't need an apartment, and it is very difficult to find a roommate.\n\n**What action can I take if they choose not to respond?** I don't have much experience in this area, but  we do have records of our emails and any lack of follow up from the office.

If ten hours a day for 3-5 days is ok, what if we double that?  What if it's a week, or two weeks?\n\nIt depends on the time of day.

What expenses are you referring?  An unnecessary hotel stay, which will be deemed unnecessary by the management company, and most likely the courts, food? will be the same as the hotel.  Loss of income, that would only be if you couldn't figure that you need to leave for work before 8 am.  OP's GF's issue is that she gets off at 7 am, what if she can't get home before 8. and what if she wants to go out and do something after work, she will have to plan ahead accordingly and usually the contractor will work with her as long as she's not coming in and out every 15 minutes.", "score": 1}, {"id": "fyzumd5", "body": "It sounds wrong.

He told me he had received a complaint. We had also been looking into building a fence soon, which he said is also against the rules. This visit is the first step in rule enforcement.\n\nHere's the thing: A number of people in our neighborhood insist that we have a neighborhood association and not an HOA, and thus it is voluntary and they have no power to enforce the rules (including someone on the board). They say only one new phase of our neighborhood has an HOA and it is a completely different organization because it is only now being built 60 years later (that is another story). I asked the president whether our organization was voluntary or not, he gave me a non-answer. I asked him what the penalties were if we failed to comply and he said they could not put a lien on the house, but the next step if we didn't resolve it would be to get lawyers involved. I know that at least 1/3 of the residents don't pay dues, many people of signs (political or otherwise) and there are other rule violations all over (e.g., storing boats or trailers).\n\nWhen we moved in, we were told by the previous owners that this was an HOA and we signed something as part of our closing saying it was mandatory with annual dues, which we paid last year under that impression.

In MI, HOAs have to file with the state and file annual reports. The earliest available was 2007, in which the organization described itself as a neighborhood association. In 2009, it began referring to itself as a homeowner's association. I contacted the county and there are no deed restrictions related to an HOA, just public utility easements.

There must be a written process that is ALWAYS followed for rule infractions, otherwise they have no legal standing to enforce against you.

Still, depending on who put the restrictions in place (if this originated with the sellers, or if they were passing along something that's been in place before they bought the house) then the HOA might not be able to enforce the rules against you, even if you technically agreed to follow the rules. This varies by state, and I'm not sure what the rules are in Michigan.\n3. If this is voluntary, I'd still read over things carefully. Maybe signing up originally was voluntary (even if you were mislead and told it was mandatory) but once you signed up, you might still be bound by what you signed, though if you were mislead there might be a defense.\n4. Selective enforcement actually matters a lot. It completely challenges their legitimacy, and if they're allowing everyone else to do it, you can argue that the bylaws are basically void because they don't care when other people do these things.

Try to get dates if you can (even if it's just 'yeah in fall of 2008 I had an Obama sign in my yard') because that can make a difference for arguing that even if it is an HOA, they're precluded from enforcing the bylaw because they've waived the rule too many times for too many people.\n\nNAL, and honestly, HOA law is pretty sticky.

LL claims he had 21 days from June 30th, but I moved out 10 days earlier and even saw him that day, he saw me leave in a huge truck (he actually tried to have my moving truck towed, which cost me $150), I told him keys were on the counter and that I wouldn't be back.\n\nAs far as the charges, all of them are estimates, no actual damages or receipts. $10k is from a contractor estimate, $3k is for a month's rent (he says work will take 4 weeks), and then $2k in various BS charges.... going to list them now.\n\n1. He has quote for brand new granite/quartz countertops, because of a small chip size of dime in the cheap laminate countertop I had. There were already 4 other similarly sized chips in the countertop when I moved in.\n2. In quote there is a brand new stainless steel sink and plumbing for sink, because of a 1mm x 4mm chip in the ceramic sink. (chip happened when cleaning a pan that slipped)\n3. Brand new high end gas stove, because there is some carbon buildup on the cheap stove I had that was impossible to clean. It worked fine but it was stained even before I moved in (though it did get worse over 7 years).\n4. Brand new high end dishwasher. He claims my (shitty and old) dishwasher is \"noisy and not draining\", which is true and I've complained about it. Isn't that his responsibility?\n5. He wants $400 for \"custom drapes\" which were shitty drapes cut from discount material he did himself. A few years into tenancy he demanded I clean his drapes and didn't give care instructions, so I washed them on cold and they shrank.... he wants the $400 because they shrank\n6. He wants $250 for not returning keys when he only gave me one set, and I returned two sets (I had a backup). I don't know when he's even talking about. \n7. He wants $250 for a broken toilet valve. My toilet didn't work last couple weeks of tenancy because the valve was an old compression valve that O-Ring wore out so it wouldn't provide any water to toilet, but he is saying I damaged it.\n8. $190 for cleaning, when I left the place cleaner than I found it (and have photos to prove)\n9. Couple other random bogus stuff\n\n\nI'd like to sue him in small claims for the return of my $1k security deposit + double damages ($3k total) because he refused to do the pre-move out inspection and took more than 21 days to respond, and only included estimates not charges.

Also, the countertops were heavily chipped when I moved in, so at most I\u2019d be responsible for a small depreciation. How much extra depreciation does one chip add when there are already three not repaired - how would you figure in the previous damage vs my damage to any replacement price?

It worked when I left and you don\u2019t toss serviceable appliances because of carbon build up. No judge in the world would buy that. Regardless, the useful life is 13-15 years and I lived there 7 (please it was used when I moved in). \n\nDishwasher: a letter from a repair person stating the dishwasher can\u2019t be repaired, and of course... a receipt and date of install. Lucky me, the useful life of dishwashers is only 9 years and replacing that dishwasher that was used (?) when I moved in seven years ago will be cheap if you can dig up the receipts and prove I broke it maliciously. Oh, yes. I asked for it to be repaired repeatedly and you declined, so now you need to prove I broke it (if it\u2019s truly broken beyond repair, which I may want to check out) maliciously instead of simple wear and tear. A clogged drain line is a common dishwasher issue, and your complaint about it being loud is your problem because you bought the dishwasher to begin with. \n\nKeys - you know I returned an extra set than you gave me. I should charge you. Plus, aren\u2019t you going to rekey anyway? Is this a way to pass that cost on to me? No thank you.\n\nThe toilet - no. That\u2019s not a thing. O rings wear out, but people don\u2019t break them. Are you suggesting I removed the toilet from the floor, broke the o ring, replaced the toilet, and am now responsible for the repair? Because otherwise it\u2019s wear and tear and your responsibility.\n\nCleaning - please see attached pictures. The place was cleaner than when I moved in seven years ago. That\u2019s all that\u2019s required. If you want it cleaner than that, that\u2019s up to you and at your expense. Not mine.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about how you broke the law.

I install it brand new before you move in, and you decide to take up oil painting in every room and ruin the carpet. You move out five years later.

At this point, I fear for my family member's lives and my great-grandmother's wellbeing. \n\nHere is the main point we are at right now:\nMy great uncle (great-grandmother's son), let's call him Paul. Paul has come home to Pennsylvania from Florida to visit, along with his wife and her children. While here, he threw away an unknown amount of items from her house, possibly took items home, and installed a huge metal door with fencing around it (imagine the metal doors that stores in bad neighborhoods use to close up at night) at the top of her stairs which lead to the attic. In the attic is his childhood room, which previously held 0 possessions of his. There is also a second bedroom and attic area full of my great-grandmother's items, such as winter clothing, home decor, christmas decor, painting supplies, and way more. She is now unable to access them.\n \nThis door was installed WITHOUT My great-grandmother knowing and without her approval. I am unsure if she approved him to get rid of or take any items. My brother believes he found a listening device in the home but that is not confirmed. I would not be surprised if Paul is listening and waiting to fly back at any moment.\n\nA little more background:\nMy brother has been staying at my my great-grandmother's home nightly for the past couple months. Her husband passed recently and it was more so she could have company. He stayed in what used to be Paul's childhood bedroom. Paul and his wife stay in that room when they visit, so my brother cleaned it out but still had some of his clothes, a TV, an Xbox, and money in the room. This was all put away and shouldn't have hindered on their stay. \n\nThis infuriated Paul. He threw my brother's items down the stairs. Told him to get everything and leave. Told him he is not welcome on the property ever again. He has gotten in his face screaming. We do not know why to this day. My brother is 18 and is beyond beside himself. He has been bawling and trying to figure out what he did wrong. \n\nMy brother's girlfriend has also being staying in the home, with permission from my great-grandmother and her own family. Together, they have been helping my great-grandmother clean, cook, and keeping her company. \n\nOn the night that Paul told them to get their stuff and leave, my brother and his girlfriend both went to the house to do just that. While there, Paul's wife grabbed a hold of my brother's girlfriend by the back of the neck. She said, and I quote, \"Come here little bitch. Paul, do you want to see me beat a little girl's ass?\" This occurred in front of my great-grandmother and the wife's children. My brother's girlfriend did not retaliate, she got away and went outside. She had done nothing prior and only said \"I'm going to get my stuff and am leaving.\" \n\nPaul told my brother he is not allowed to step foot on the property. And if he does, he will find out and he will do something about it. I believe the exact words were \"there will be to hell to pay.\" Paul does not own the home, the land, or anything. It will not even be left to him in the will because it is now owned by the bank. \n\nThere is more that has occurred, but these are the major items. During all of this, my great-grandmother sat back and watched. She never asked Paul and his family to leave.

My family is afraid to go to the cops because my brother has been in some (minor) trouble in the past. I keep saying that doesn' tmatter but they are against it.
